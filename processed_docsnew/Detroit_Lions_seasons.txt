navigation , search     the detroit lions are a professional american football team based in detroit , michigan . they are members of the nfc north division of the national football conference (nfc) in the national football league (nfl), and play their home games at ford field in downtown detroit . originally based in portsmouth , ohio and called the portsmouth spartans, the team began play in 1928 as an independent professional team. 1 the 2015 season was their 86th in the nfl.  the lions have won four nfl championships , tied for 9th overall in total championships amongst all 32 nfl franchises; although the last was in 1957, which gives the club the second-longest nfl championship drought behind the arizona cardinals . the lions are the only franchise to finish a full (non-strike shortened) regular season with no wins or ties since the move to sixteen season games in 1978, going 0–16 during the 2008 nfl season . they are also one of four current teams, and the only one in the nfc, to have never played in the super bowl .     contents               edit   note: the finish, wins, losses, and ties columns list regular season results and exclude any postseason play. italicized
