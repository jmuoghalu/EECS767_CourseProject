navigation , search     for complete team history, see history of the green bay packers .      lambeau field , the home of the green bay packers since 1957.    this article is a compilation of the list of seasons completed by the green bay packers  american football  franchise of the national football league . the list documents the season-by-season records of the packers' franchise from 1919 to the present, including postseason records, and league awards for individual players or head coaches. the packers franchise was founded in 1919 by curly lambeau , and played two seasons of competitive football against teams around wisconsin and michigan before entering the nfl.  the green bay packers have played over one thousand games in a total of 94 seasons, 92 of which were in the nfl. in those games, the club won 13 professional american football championships including nine nfl championships and four super bowls —the most in the nfl. the franchise captured 18 nfl divisional titles and eight nfl conference championships, and recorded the second most regular season (664) and overall victories (693) of any nfl franchise, behind the chicago bears .  the franchise has experienced three major periods of continued success in their history. the first period of success came from 1929 – 1944 , when the packers were named nfl champions six times. this period saw the packers become the first dynasty of american football and the only nfl team to ever be named nfl champions in three consecutive seasons ( 1929 – 1931 ). the second period of success was between 1960 – 1967 , where the packers won five nfl championships and the first two super bowls . the packers also won three consecutive nfl championships for the second time in franchise history ( 1965 – 1967 ). the most recent period of success ranges from 1993 – present , where the franchise has reached the playoffs 17 times, including three super bowl appearances, winning two in 1996 and 2010 .  the packers have also experienced extended periods of failure in their history. the two most notable times of failure were from 1945 – 1958 , where the franchise never placed higher than 3rd place and recorded the worst record of any packers team, going 1–10–1 in 1958 . the second period of failure occurred between 1968 – 1991 , where the club only went to the playoffs twice, and recorded only six winning seasons.  edit      nfl champions  (1920–1966)     super bowl champions  (1967–present)     conference champions     division champions     wild card berth     one-game playoff berth     edit

league until 1921.  the team with the best record at the end of the season was named the nfl champion.  this marked the first ever "three-peat," where a team wins three consecutive nfl championships. the packers are still the only team to achieve this.  the score of the playoff game is in parenthesis with the packers score first no matter of the outcome.  even though this is the franchise's first super bowl victory, it is their 10th league championship hence the number 10 after the super bowl i line.  the 1967 nfl season marks the first season in the league's history where the league was divided into two conferences which were subdivided into two divisions. up to 1967, the league was either divided into two divisions, two conferences, or neither.  this marked the second time that the packers have achieved three consecutive nfl championships.  as a result of the nfl-afl merger, the league was broken into two conferences, with the nfc adopting the name "nfc central division" for the division the packers were in, which became the "north division" in 2002. this is different from the nfl central division, which only lasted from 1967–1969.  1982 was a strike-shorten season so the league was divided up into two conferences instead of its normal divisional alignment.  the strike of 1987 reduced the regular season schedule from 16 to 15 games.  this game is known as the mud bowl .  this marked the first super bowl loss for the packers and the first loss in a championship game since 1960.  this marked the first time any player has ever won three ap nfl mvps, and the only time a player has won three consecutive mvp awards.  the nfl does not count any seasons played outside of their league in their official records. if the 1919 and 1920 season were counted, the packers would have 19 more wins, 2 more losses, and 1 more tie in their total results.   edit   general           specific    edit              v  t  e              founded in 1919  based in ,          franchise
