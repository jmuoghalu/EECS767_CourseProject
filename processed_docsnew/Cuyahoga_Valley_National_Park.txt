3m lost at trial. 5  cleanup began in 1987 and had not been completed as of mid-2011, although most of the area had been restored to its original state as wetlands. 6  the area was redesignated a national park by congress on october 11, 2000, 7 with the passage of the department of the interior and related agencies appropriations act, 2001 , house bill 4578, 106th congress. 8 it is administered by the national park service . david berger national memorial in beachwood, ohio is also managed through cuyahoga valley national park.  the richfield coliseum , a multipurpose arena in the cuyahoga river area, was demolished in 1999 and the now-empty site became part of cuyahoga valley national park upon its designation in 2000. it has since become a grassy meadow popular with birdwatchers.  edit      the towpath trail provides recreational activities for visitors    many visitors spend their time hiking or bicycling the park's many trails which visit its numerous attractions, including the crushed limestone along portions of the 20-mile (32 km) towpath trail, following a former stretch of the 308-mile (496 km) ohio and erie canal .  waterfalls, rolling hills, caves and winding river scenery attract many park visitors. steep narrow ravines, a rolling floodplain, and lush farmland contrast with one another throughout the park. animal life is also plentiful. the ledges provides a boulder-strewn cliff to relax and watch the sunset over the wooded scenery below. sled-riding is popular during the winter at kendall hills. 9  the park offers an array of preserved and restored displays of 19th and early 20th century sustainable farming and pastoral or rural living, while catering to contemporary interests with art exhibits, outdoor concerts, and scenic excursion and special event railroad tours on the cuyahoga valley scenic railroad . 10  it includes compatible-use sites not owned by the federal government, including several local regional parks in the cleveland metroparks and metro parks, serving summit county systems, blossom music center , and the hale farm & village . in the mid-1980s, the park hosted the national folk festival .  edit  the multi-purpose ohio & erie canal towpath trail was developed by the national park service and is the major trail through cuyahoga valley national park. it runs almost 21 miles (33½ km) from rockside road, independence, oh in the north to summit county's bike & hike trail in the south. it follows the cuyahoga river for much of its length. restrooms can be found at several trailheads along the way and commercial food and drink can be found on rockside rd., the boston store, in peninsula, and at the farmer's market on botzum rd., (seasonally). there are also several visitors centers along the way. at rockside rd. it connects to cleveland metroparks trail which travels another 6 miles (9½ km) north. the summit county trail runs through akron and south. the "towpath trail" continues through stark and tuscarawas counties down to zoar, ohio; almost 70 more miles with only one significant (1 mile) interruption. sections of the towpath trail outside of cuyahoga valley national park are owned and maintained by various state and local agencies. the trail also meets the buckeye trail in the national park (near boston store). another section of the summit county bike & hike trail system (connecting to the nearby brandywine falls , and also to the cleveland metroparks bedford reservation and solon in cuyahoga county; hudson and stow in summit county; and kent and ravenna in portage county, ohio) is near-by.  seasonally, the cuyahoga valley scenic railroad allows visitors to travel along the towpath from rockside rd. to akron getting off/on at any of the 6 other stops along the way. this is especially popular with bikers and for viewing and photographing fall colors. cvsr is independently owned and operated. (note - as of may, 2014, flood damage has limited the train to the 6 stops north of indigo lake station. the entire route to akron is expected to be open shortly.)  edit      restored ohio & erie canal lock    the towpath trail follows the historic route of the ohio & erie canal . before the canal was built, ohio was a sparsely settled wilderness where travel was difficult and getting crops to market was nearly impossible. the canal, built between 1825 and 1832, provided a successful transportation route from cleveland , on lake erie , to portsmouth , on the ohio river . the canal opened up ohio to the rest of the settled eastern united states. 11  there are numerous wayside exhibits that provide information about canal features and sites of historic interest. 12 there is also a virtual tour. 11 13  today visitors can walk or ride along the same path that the mules used to tow the canal boats loaded with goods and passengers. the scene is different than it was then; the canal was full of water carrying a steady flow of boats amongst the constant conversations of "canawlers." evidence of beavers can be seen in many places along the trail. 11  edit      stanford house located in cuyahoga valley national park, ohio    located in the scenic cuyahoga valley near peninsula, ohio, stanford house is a historic 19th-century farm home built in the 1830s by george stanford, one of the first settlers in the western reserve. in 1978, the nps purchased the property to act as a youth hostel in conjunction with the american youth hostels (ayh) organization. in march 2011, stanford hostel became stanford house, cuyahoga valley national park's first in-park lodging facility. the home was renovated by the conservancy for cuyahoga valley national park 14 and the national park service. 15 16  edit    map all coordinates using osm  map all coordinates using google  map up to 200 coordinates using bing    export all coordinates as kml    export all coordinates as georss

george wallace, who built a sawmill next to brandywine falls in 1814. he encouraged others to move to the area, including his brother-in-law, who built a grist mill on the opposite side of the falls. with inexpensive land available and the presence of mills to provide lumber, flour, and corn meal, the village of brandywine began to grow. today only a couple of buildings remain from the village but historic photos and remnants of building foundations allow us to remember the brandywine village that once was. 25     civilian conservation corps structures  the civilian conservation corps was responsible for the construction of some of the most attractive buildings in the valley. happy days visitor center as well as the ledges, octagon, and lake shelters were built of wormy american
