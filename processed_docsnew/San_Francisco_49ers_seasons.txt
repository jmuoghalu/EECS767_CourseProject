    list of san francisco 49ers seasons - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                                     list of san francisco 49ers seasons     from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia      jump to: navigation , search     this is a list of seasons completed by the san francisco 49ers , an american football  franchise representing the san francisco bay area . the 49ers are members of the west division in the national football conference (nfc) of the national football league (nfl). the list documents the season-by-season records of the 49ers' franchise from 1946 to present, including postseason records, and league awards for individual players or head coaches. the san francisco 49ers began play in 1946 as charter members of the all-america football conference .  the franchise has experienced major periods of success in their history from the early 1980s to the late 1990s, during this period, they had 16 straight winning season (all with 10 wins or more); they played in five super bowls ( xvi , xix , xxiii and xxiv , and xxix ), winning all five of them; and won a total of 22 playoff games.  the 49ers have also experienced stretches of failure in their history. when the 49ers joined the nfl after the aafc-nfl merger in 1950, they never won a division or conference title, and only finished as high as second once from 1950–1969. after winning three consecutive division titles from 1970–1972, they would return to losing in 1973 and achieved only one winning season for the rest of the decade. another playoff drought lasted from 2003 – 2010 , a stretch of eight non-winning seasons. this drought finally came to an end when the 49ers won their division with a 13–3 record in 2011 ; they earned three straight berths in the nfc championship game.   for complete
