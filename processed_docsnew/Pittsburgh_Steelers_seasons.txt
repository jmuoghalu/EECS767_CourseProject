    list of pittsburgh steelers seasons - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                                     list of pittsburgh steelers seasons     from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia      jump to: navigation , search      for complete team history, see history of the pittsburgh steelers   this is a list of seasons completed by the pittsburgh steelers  american football franchise in the national football league (nfl). the list documents the season-by-season records of the franchise from its founding (as the pirates ) in 1933 to present. the list also includes postseason records, and league awards for individual players or head coaches.  founded in 1933, the steelers are the oldest franchise in the american football conference (afc); only seven clubs in the national football conference (nfc) have longer tenures in the nfl. the team struggled to be competitive in its early history, posting winning records in just eight of its first 39 seasons. since the afl–nfl merger in 1970, however, it has appeared in eight super bowls and is the only team to have won the super bowl six times. the six championships place the steelers fourth in the league in terms of total championships (including those prior to the first super bowl), trailing only the green bay packers (13 championships), the chicago bears (9) and the new york giants (8). 1 the club's 15 afc championship game appearances are a record. in addition, they have hosted more conference championship games (11) than any franchise in either conference, and are tied with the dallas cowboys , new england patriots and denver broncos with eight super bowl appearances.  from 1974 to 1979 the franchise became the first nfl franchise to win four super bowl titles in six seasons, a feat which is yet to be matched. the 2005 team was the first sixth-seeded team to advance to a conference championship game since the playoff field was expanded to 12 teams in 1990 ; the same team also became the first sixth-seed to win the super bowl . the steelers are 6–2 in super bowls , winning super bowl ix , super bowl x , super bowl xiii , super bowl xiv , super bowl xl , super bowl xliii and losing super bowl xxx and super bowl xlv .  the team currently competes in the north division of the american football conference (afc).   key to color-coding of list of seasons table   nfl champions (1920–1969)
