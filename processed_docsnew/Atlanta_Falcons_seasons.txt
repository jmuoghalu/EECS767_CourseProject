    list of atlanta falcons seasons - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                                     list of atlanta falcons seasons     from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia      jump to: navigation , search     this is a list of seasons completed by the atlanta falcons  american football  franchise of the national football league (nfl). the list documents the season-by-season records of the falcons' franchise from 1966 to present, including postseason records, and league awards for individual players or head coaches.  worthy of note is that the falcons did not record consecutive winning seasons until 2009, when the team won their final three games of the regular season and finished with a 9–7 record after winning their season finale against the tampa bay buccaneers . atlanta has since added its first stretch of 5 straight winning seasons, with a 13–3 record in 2010, with a 10-6 record in 2011, and with a 13-3 record in 2012, although they posted a 4-12 record in 2013.  edit   note: the finish, wins, losses, and ties columns list regular season results and exclude any postseason play. italicized numbers mean that the records are subject to change each week due to regular season or postseason games being played.     super bowl champions (1970–present)  conference champions  division champions  wild card berth  one-game playoff berth      season  team  league
