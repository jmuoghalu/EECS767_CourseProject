navigation , search     for complete team history, see history of the cincinnati bengals .      paul brown stadium, current home of the cincinnati bengals    the cincinnati bengals  franchise was founded in 1968 as a member of the west division of the american football league (afl). the bengals joined the national football league (nfl) as a result of the afl–nfl merger prior to 1970 . this list documents the franchise's completed seasons from 1968 to present, including postseason records and results from postseason games. 1 the bengals have played over 700 games in their history, which includes two conference championships, eight division championships, and 12 playoff appearances.  the franchise has experienced several extended periods of success in their history. these periods came from 1981 to 1990 when the bengals qualified for the playoffs four times and played in two super bowls , and from 2009 to the present. however, during a 14-year span—1991 to 2004—the bengals did not qualify for the playoffs. during this time, the franchise had nine seasons with 10 or more losses, and three of those seasons the franchise had the league's worst record. since 2005 the bengals have been more successful, posting seven winning seasons, three division titles and seven wild card playoff berths (including an active streak of five consecutive playoff seasons, a first in franchise history).     contents                 edit       finish  final position in league, division, or conference    w  wins    l  loses     conference champions     division champions     wild card berth
