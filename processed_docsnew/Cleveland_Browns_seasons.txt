    list of cleveland browns seasons - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                                      list of cleveland browns seasons     from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia      jump to: navigation , search     the cleveland browns were charter members of the all-america football conference (aafc) when the league was founded in 1946 . from 1946 to 1949 , the browns won each of the league's four championships. the national football league (nfl) does not recognize the browns' aafc championships; however, the pro football hall of fame  does recognize the team's championships, which is reflected in this list. when the aafc folded in 1949, the browns were absorbed into the nfl in 1950 . the browns went on to win three nfl championships , nearly dominating the nfl in the 1950s, and won one more nfl championship in 1964. the team has yet to appear in a super bowl , however. overall, the team has eight championships: four in the aafc, and four in the nfl.  in 1996 , then-browns owner art modell made the decision to move the team from cleveland to baltimore . an agreement between the city of cleveland and the nfl kept the team's history, name and colors in cleveland, while modell's new team would be regarded as an expansion team. the baltimore ravens would begin play in 1996, and the browns would return to the league in 1999 . for record-keeping purposes, the browns are considered to have suspended operations from 1996 to 1998 , which is reflected in this list.  edit   for a complete team history, see history of the cleveland browns .  the
