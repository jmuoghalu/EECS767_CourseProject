    list of miami dolphins seasons - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                                     list of miami dolphins seasons     from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia      jump to: navigation , search     this is a list of seasons completed by the miami dolphins  american football  franchise of the national football league (nfl). the list documents the season-by-season records of the dolphins' franchise from 1966 to present, including postseason records, and league awards for individual players or head coaches.  although the miami dolphins were not successful before joining the nfl, from 1970 when they played their first season after the nfl-afl merger until 2001 they were one of the most successful teams in the league, playing in the postseason on 22 occasions over those 32 years and winning 335 and tying two of 528 games for an overall win percentage of 63.6. early in this period the dolphins won their only two super bowls in consecutive seasons, in the process achieving the only modern-day perfect season in any major professional sports league during only their third year in the nfl. much of this success was orchestrated by coach don shula who joined the team in 1970 and stayed with them until his retirement in 1995.  after shula retired in 1995, the dolphins remained a force for six years under successors jimmy johnson and dave wannstedt , but since 2002 and especially since 2004 have fallen on harder times, reaching the postseason only once in the past eleven seasons. in 2007 , they nearly suffered an anti-perfect season , winning only one game in overtime.  for complete team history, see history of the miami dolphins .     contents                  edit   note: the finish, wins, losses, and ties columns list regular season results and
