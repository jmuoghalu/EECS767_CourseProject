to: navigation , search         qualcomm stadium , where the chargers have played their home games since 1967    the san diego chargers are a professional american football  franchise based in san diego , california . they are members of the west division of the american football conference (afc) in the national football league (nfl). the chargers franchise was founded in 1959 by barron hilton and played the 1960 season in los angeles as part of the american football league (afl). in the next season, the chargers moved to san diego , becoming the san diego chargers. 1  the franchise has experienced three major periods of success. the first was from 1960 to 1965 , when the chargers were afl west champions five times and afl champions once. the second was from 1978 to 1982 , when the chargers had winning seasons (seasons with more wins than losses) in each of these years, and won three consecutive division championships for the second time in franchise history. the most recent accomplishments range from 2004 to 2009 , with the franchise reaching the playoffs five times in six years. their only super bowl appearance was in 1994 .  the chargers have experienced three notable periods of decline. between 1970 and 1977 , the chargers never won more games than they lost as part of a 13-year period without playing in the postseason, including four consecutive years last in their division from 1972 to 1975, in which year they bottomed out before two late wins avoided the nfl's first 0–14 season. from 1983 to 1991 , they never placed higher than third in their division and did not make the playoffs. from 1996 to 2003 , the team had no winning seasons, and had their worst season ever, winning only one of 16 games in 2000 . 2  the chargers have been division champions nine times including 2009, all of them in the afc west . they have been conference champions six times, but only once since the afl-nfl merger in 1970. as of the end of the 2010 season , the chargers had played 787 regular and post-season games in 51 seasons, and have appeared in the post-season 16 times. 2  edit  note: the finish, wins, losses, and ties columns list regular season results and

the holy roller game.  the chargers finished ahead of oakland in the afc west based on better net points in division games.  the chargers finished ahead of the denver broncos based on better divisional record.  this game is known as the epic in miami .  this game was known as the freezer bowl .  the 1982 season was shortened by a strike , so the league was divided up into two conferences instead of its normal divisional alignment.  the strike of 1987 reduced the regular season schedule from 16 to 15 games.   edit   general             specific                   v  t  e    nfl team
