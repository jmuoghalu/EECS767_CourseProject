football team playing in the national football league (nfl). this list documents the season-by-season records of the colts franchise from 1953 to present, including postseason records and league awards for individual players or head coaches. in 1953, a baltimore -based group led by carroll rosenbloom gained the rights to a new baltimore franchise. rosenbloom was granted an nfl team, and was awarded the holdings of the defunct dallas texans organization. 1 the new team was named the colts after the previous team that folded after the 1950 nfl season . 2 after 31 seasons in baltimore, colts owner robert irsay  moved the team to indianapolis , indiana . 3  the colts have won two super bowl championships ( super bowl v and super bowl xli ). they also played in and lost super bowl iii and super bowl xliv . before the afl and nfl merged in 1970 , 4 they won three nfl championships ( 1958 , 1959 , and 1968 ). by winning super bowl xli the colts became the first team that played its home games in a domed stadium to win a super bowl held in an outdoor stadium. 5  after the colts owner  jim irsay hired tony dungy in 2002 , 6 the colts made the playoffs for nine straight seasons. they won five straight afc south titles from 2003 to 2007 and had seven consecutive seasons of 12 or more victories from 2003 to 2009 , the first time that has been achieved in the nfl's 90-year history. 7 much of the team's success throughout the 2000s was attributed to the trio of general manager bill polian , coach dungy, and quarterback peyton manning . 8  in the 2013 season , the colts secured their first division championship since manning's departure and first under quarterback andrew luck and head coach chuck pagano .     contents                      edit      peyton manning won
