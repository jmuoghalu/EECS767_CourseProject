    list of chicago bears seasons - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                                      list of chicago bears seasons     from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia      jump to: navigation , search     for complete team history, see history of the chicago bears .  for complete list of team awards, see list of chicago bears award winners .  the chicago bears  franchise was originally founded as the decatur staleys, a charter member of the american professional football association (apfa). the team moved to chicago, illinois in 1921 and changed its name to the bears in 1922, the same year the apfa changed its name to the national football league (nfl). 1 2 this list documents the franchise's completed seasons from 1920 to present, including postseason records and results from postseason games. 3  the chicago bears have played over one thousand games in their history, which includes eight nfl championships victories and one super bowl win. the bears' nine championships are the second most by any team in history. the franchise has captured 18 nfl divisional titles and four nfl conference championships. the bears have also recorded more regular season and overall victories than any other nfl franchise. 4 5 6  the franchise has experienced three major periods of continued success in their history. the first period of success came from 1932 to 1946 when the bears played in nine nfl championship games, winning six of them. this period saw the bears participate in the first ever national football league playoff game , the first ever official nfl championship game , and become the american football sports dynasty of the 1940s. the bears played in four straight nfl championship games between 1940 and 1944 , winning three of them, including an nfl record 73–0 victory over the washington redskins in 1940 . 7 8 the second period of success was between 1984 and 1991 when the bears captured six nfc central division titles in eight years and won super bowl xx . 9 10 a brief period of success stretched from 2005 to 2007 when the franchise captured two straight nfc north titles and a nfc championship title, which earned them a berth in super bowl xli , a game that the club lost to the indianapolis colts . 11  the bears have experienced failure in their history. the franchise finished in last place within its division five times in the 1970s. 12 in 1970, the team moved from wrigley field to soldier field to play its home games. in the mid- to late 1990s and early 2000s, the club posted six seasons with 10 or more losses. by chance, these two decades—the 1970s and 1990s—are the only decades in the bears history that the franchise has not won or played for an nfl championship or super bowl. in the 1969 season, the franchise posted their worst regular season record with a 1–13 showing. 13     contents                 edit      soldier field, current home of the chicago bears         (#)  the order of league championship won by

april 30, 1921. clubs played schedules that included games against nonleague opponents.  the nfl did not hold playoff games until 1932. the team that finished with the best regular season record was named the league champions.  the result of the 1932 nfl playoff game to determine the nfl champion between the bears and the portsmouth spartans . the game counted in the standings and broke the tie.  the score of the playoff game is in parenthesis with the winning score first no matter the outcome for the bears.  the bears were denied perfect seasons on two accounts. the first one was in the 1934 when the 13–0 club lost to the new york giants in the championship game. the second occurrence happened in 1942 when the 11–0 club was denied perfection and a "three-peat" by the washington redskins .  the bears victory of the redskins in the 1940 nfl championship is an nfl record for greatest margin of victory and most points scored in a game.  the bears tied with the rams for 1st place at the end of the season, but they lost the one-game playoff tiebreaker and therefore did not win a conference championship.  the 1967 nfl season marks the first season in the league's history where the league was divided into two conferences which were subdivided into two divisions. up to 1967, the league was either divided into two divisions, two conferences, or neither.  as a result of the afl-nfl merger , the league was broken into two conferences, with the afl teams moving into the american football conference.  as of the 2010 nfl season , this season marks the last tie game the bears played. it was a game at soldier field on september 24, 1972 against the los angeles rams . the game ended at 13–13.  the 1982 season was a strike-shortened season so the league was divided up into two conferences instead of its normal divisional alignment.  this was the franchise's first super bowl victory and their ninth league championship.  the strike of 1987 reduced the regular season schedule from 16 to 15 games.  the divisional playoff game against the eagles was known as the fog bowl due to the heavy fog that covered the field for most of the game.  as of the 2010 nfl season , this is the second postseason meeting of the bears and green bay packers in their long standing rivalry .  records as of january 23, 2011 .   edit   general            specific
