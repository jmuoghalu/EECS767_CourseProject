    list of seattle seahawks seasons - wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                                     list of seattle seahawks seasons     from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia      jump to: navigation , search     this article is a compilation of the list of seasons completed by the seattle seahawks  american football  franchise of the national football league (nfl). the list documents the season-by-season records of the seahawks' franchise from 1976 to present, including postseason records, and league awards for individual players or head coaches. as of the end of the 2015 nfl season, the seahawks have 19 winning seasons, 17 losing seasons and 4 seasons where they finished 8–8. with a 35–6 week 14 win over the baltimore ravens on december 13 during the 2015 season, not only did the seahawks improved to 8–5 at that point in the season, but the seahawks' all–time franchise regular season win–loss record improved to 313–312–0; this marked the first time ever in team history that the seahawks have had an overall winning regular season win–loss record (a win–loss record above .500). the seahawks are the one of four north american men's professional sports teams that have played in seattle with an all–time winning record, after the seattle metropolitans (the first american team to win the stanley cup in 1917, folded in 1924), the seattle supersonics (who moved to oklahoma city and became the thunder in the summer of 2008), and the seattle sounders fc (established in 2007 as an expansion franchise, currently active). therefore, the seahawks are currently one of two active north american men's professional sports team located in seattle with an overall winning record.   for complete team history, see history of the seattle seahawks      contents
