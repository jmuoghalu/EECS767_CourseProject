(later, the glen canyon dam would be built upriver.) in 1975, the former marble canyon national monument, which followed the colorado river northeast from the grand canyon to lee's ferry , was made part of grand canyon national park. in 1979, unesco declared the park a world heritage site .  in 2010, grand canyon national park was honored with its own coin under the america the beautiful quarters program. 8  edit  the grand canyon, including its extensive system of tributary canyons, is valued for its combination of size, depth, and exposed layers of colorful rocks dating back to precambrian times. the canyon itself was created by the incision of the colorado river and its tributaries after the colorado plateau was uplifted, causing the colorado river system to develop along its present path.  the primary public areas of the park are the north and south rims of the grand canyon itself. the rest of the park is extremely rugged and remote, although many places are accessible by pack trail and backcountry roads. only the navajo bridge near page connects the rims by road in arizona; this journey can take around five hours by car. otherwise, the two rims of the canyon are connected via the mike o'callaghan–pat tillman memorial bridge and the hoover dam . 9  the park headquarters are at grand canyon village , not far from the south entrance to the park, near one of the most popular viewpoints. park accommodations are operated by xanterra parks and resorts .  edit  the north rim is a smaller, more remote area with less tourist activity. it is accessed by arizona state route 67 . 10  edit      from desert view on the south rim    the south rim is more accessible than the north rim; 11 most visitors to the park come to the south rim, arriving on arizona state route 64 . the highway enters the park through the south entrance, near tusayan, arizona , and heads eastward, leaving the park through the east entrance. 11  interstate 40 provides access to the area from the south. from the north, u.s. route 89 connects utah , colorado , and the north rim to the south rim. 12 overall, some thirty miles of the south rim are accessible by road.  edit  the grand canyon village is located at the north end of u.s. route 180 , coming from flagstaff. it is a full-service community, including lodging, fuel, food, souvenirs, a hospital, churches, and access to trails and guided walks and talks. 9  edit  several lodging facilities are available along the south rim. hotels and other lodging include: el tovar, bright angel lodge, kachina lodge, thunderbird lodge, and maswik lodge, all of which are located in the village area, and phantom ranch, located on the canyon floor. there is also an rv park named trailer village. all of these facilities are managed by xanterra parks & resorts , while the yavapai lodge (also in the village area) is managed by delaware north . 13  on the north rim there is the historic grand canyon lodge 13 managed by forever resorts and a campground near the lodge, managed by the national park staff. 14  edit  edit       a 6-minute video of a flight over the grand canyon    a variety of activities at the south rim cater to park visitors. the south rim drive (35 miles (56 km) is a driving tour split into two segments. the western drive to hermit's point is 8 miles (13 km) with several overlooks along the way, including mohave point, hopi point, and the powell memorial. 9 from march to december, access to hermit's rest is restricted to the free shuttle provided by the park service. the eastern portion to desert view is 25 miles (40 km), and is open to private vehicles year round.  walking tours include the rim trail, which runs west from the pipe creek viewpoint for about 8 miles (13 km) of paved road, followed by 7 miles (11 km) unpaved to hermit's rest. hikes can begin almost anywhere along this trail, and a shuttle can return hikers to their point of origin. mather point, the first view most people reach when entering from the south entrance, is a popular place to begin.  private canyon flyovers are provided by helicopters and small airplanes out of las vegas, phoenix , and the grand canyon national park airport . due to a crash in the 1990s, scenic flights are no longer allowed to fly within 1,500 feet (460 m) of the rim within the grand canyon national park. [ ] several companies offer flights that land 3,500 feet (1,100 m) in the grand canyon in hualapai indian territory. 15  edit      from toroweap overlook on the north rim    on the north rim there are few roads, however, there are some notable vehicle accessible lookout points including point imperial, roosevelt point, and cape royal. mule rides are also available that go to a variety of places including several thousand feet down into the canyon.  many visitors to the north rim choose to make use of the variety of hiking trails including the widforss trail , uncle jim's trail, the transept trail, and the north kaibab trail , the latter of which can be followed all the way down to the colorado river, and to across to the south kaibab trail and the bright angel trail , which continue up to the south rim of the grand canyon.  the toroweap overlook is located in the western part of the park on the north rim. access is via unpaved roads off route 389 west of fredonia, arizona . the roads lead through grand canyon-parashant national monument and to the overlook.  edit  the us government had halted development of a 1.6 million acres area including the national park from 1966 to 2009, during the bennett freeze , because of an ownership dispute between hopi and navajo. 16  edit  main article: grand canyon association  the grand canyon association (gca) is the national park service's official nonprofit partner. it raises private funds to benefit grand canyon national park by operating retail shops and visitor centers within the park, and providing educational opportunities about the natural and cultural history of the region.  edit         an aerial view of the little colorado river gorge near east rim of grand canyon           a 1938 poster of grand
