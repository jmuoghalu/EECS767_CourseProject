He averaged 12.9 points and 10.5 rebounds while ranking second nationally in blocks at 3.7 per game. Bamba totaled 15 double-doubles, including eight during an 11-game stretch in January and February.<\/p>\n<p>\"I don't want to take away from anything from my time at Texas,\" he told ESPN host Rachel Nichols and analysts Byron Scott and Tracy McGrady. \"I think it was actually pretty darn special. The relationships that I've built there, and the people that I've come across, I met some of my best friends in life at the University of Texas.\"<\/p>\n<p>Bamba has been considered a top-five pick since the preseason, and he slots in at No. 5 in <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/22726756/2018-nba-mock-draft-deandre-ayton-luka-doncic-trae-young-more\">Jonathan Givony's latest ESPN mock draft<\/a>.\u00a0He missed three games late in the season with a toe injury, but he returned to put up 13 points, 14 rebounds and three blocks during a first-round NCAA tournament loss to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2440/nevada-wolf-pack\">Nevada<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\"It would have taken my game to the next level,\" Bamba said of a jump to the NBA out of high school. \"Because now, what's so night and day between being a college student-athlete, is that you got to split up times for different things -- all right, now I have to actually study and write this essay; I have to crank it out because it's due tomorrow at 10 a.m.<\/p>\n<p>\"But now, I'm literally, the only thing I'm studying is myself. I'm really, like, fully invested in my body, and I'm really liking this professional thing.\"<\/p>\n<p>When asked what it would mean to be drafted by his hometown\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks\">New York Knicks<\/a>, the Harlem native indicated he hasn't tempered his expectations.<\/p>\n<p>\"That's funny,\" Bamba replied. \"I didn't know the Knicks were in contention to be the No. 1 pick.\"<\/p>\n<p>The Knicks indeed hold only a 1.7 percent chance of landing the top pick in next month's draft lottery, with the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns\">Phoenix Suns<\/a> (25 percent), <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mem/memphis-grizzlies\">Memphis Grizzlies<\/a> (19.9), <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/dal/dallas-mavericks\">Dallas Mavericks<\/a> (13.8) and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks\">Atlanta Hawks<\/a>\u00a0(13.7) having the top odds.<\/p>\n<p>\"It honestly would mean the world to me -- I grew up watching the Knicks,\" Bamba said. \"I watched the Knicks when they were at their worst, and I would always root for them because it's always been in my heart. It would be awesome, you know. I live three train stops from there.\"<\/p>\n<p>Bamba recently spent a week working out with\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3059318/joel-embiid\">Joel Embiid<\/a> while the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-76ers\">Philadelphia 76ers<\/a>\u00a0center worked back into shape after fracturing his eye socket and sustaining a concussion.<\/p>\n<p>\"He's the guy I really want to play against,\" Bamba said. \"I learned so much from him in just a couple of days of being around him. He's a guy I'm really inspired to be like, and he's the guy I want to go at.\"<\/p>\n<p>Bamba said his game fits into what the NBA is looking for -- \"guys who can really stretch the floor out at the 5, but be elite rim protectors who can guard the 1 through 5 positions,\" and that in the five weeks since he has been preparing for the draft, he has been working on developing the mechanics of his outside jump shot.<\/p>\n<p>\"Making sure that my jump shot resembled more of a jump shot -- you know, everything was smooth -- rather than a catapult,\" Bamba said. \"I recently lowered my pocket, and my follow-through looks good and everything is smooth. I still got ways to go with my jump shot.

He made his professional basketball debut shortly after at the Euroleague qualifying tournament for VEF Riga but moved to Spain at the beginning of 2015.<\/p>\n<p><photo1><\/p>\n<p>Kurucs suffered some injuries that slowed his development and has yet to get his professional career fully on track. He entered the 2017 NBA draft against the wishes of Barcelona but was forced to withdraw at the deadline despite strong interest in the late first round, as his exorbitant buyout, which reportedly was around 4 million euros, would have made it difficult for him to have joined the NBA immediately. Kurucs has been embroiled in conflict since then due to his refusal to sign a contract extension with Barcelona. He has one year remaining on his deal.<\/p>\n<p>ESPN draft analyst Mike Schmitz was in Spain earlier this month and was able to get a better feel for Kurucs' situation, as well as his strengths and weaknesses as a prospect.<\/p>\n<p>\"Kurucs scored 16 first-half points, making shots from the perimeter and attacking the rim while also showing his shortcomings as a decision-maker and defender,\" Schmitz said. \"He's in a tough situation when he takes the floor in LEB Gold, as he often tries to do too much, anxious to prove himself. Kurucs is starting to get more consistent playing time with Barcelona II, though, seeing action in five of the last six games and averaging 23.4 points per 40 minutes on 63.6 percent from 2 and 35.3 percent from 3. Even so, the fact that Kurucs only practices with the first team and comes down with a score-first mentality has caused internal strife among his coaches and teammates.\"<\/p>\n<p>Kurucs, 20, is currently slated 39th in the latest ESPN mock draft. His combination of size, polished scoring instincts and multipositional versatility is attractive in today's NBA. As an international player who is making himself eligible for the second time, he would have one more opportunity to go through the NBA draft process should he withdraw his name at the early-entry deadline June 11.<\/p>\n<p>Kurucs' ability to attend private workouts or participate in the NBA International Elite Camp in Treviso in early June will likely play a significant role in his decision. Few teams have been able to scout him thoroughly, with many top decision-makers electing not to schedule trips to watch him due to the uncertainty of what team he'll be playing with on any given day and whether he'll see any minutes. Regardless, many scouts consider him to be the third-best international prospect in the draft and an attractive stash option for a team that is strapped for roster spots in the short term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n"},{"images":[{"alt":"Kevin Huerter, Trevon Bluiett","width":600,"name":"Kevin Huerter, Trevon Bluiett [600x400]","peers":[{"alt":"Kevin Huerter, Trevon Bluiett","width":1296,"name":"Kevin Huerter, Trevon Bluiett [1296x729]","id":18927376,"type":"header","credit":"Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2017/0316/r191003_1296x729_16-9.jpg","height":729},{"alt":"Kevin Huerter, Trevon Bluiett","width":1296,"name":"Kevin Huerter, Trevon Bluiett [1296x864]","id":18927381,"type":"header","credit":"Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2017/0316/r191003_1296x864_3-2.jpg","height":864},{"alt":"Kevin Huerter, Trevon Bluiett","width":1296,"name":"Kevin Huerter, Trevon Bluiett [1296x518]","id":18927385,"type":"header","credit":"Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2017/0316/r191003_1296x518_5-2.jpg","height":518}],"id":18927383,"type":"header","credit":"Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2017/0316/r191003_600x400_3-2.jpg","height":400}],"feedDisplayType":"Default","description":"Kevin Huerter, who averaged 14.8 points per game as a sophomore for Maryland, will enter the NBA draft and is a projected late-first-round pick.","section":"NBA Draft","categorized":"2018-04-20T18:08:39Z","linkText":"Terps' Huerter enters draft, won't hire agent","allowAMP":true,"published":"2018-04-20T18:08:39Z","type":"HeadlineNews","allowComments":true,"premium":false,"nowId":"1-23263286","related":[{"images":[{"width":608,"name":"McDonald's Boys All-American Game (Nassir Little) [608x342] - Copy","peers":[{"width":1296,"name":"McDonald's Boys All-American Game (Nassir Little) [1296x1296]","id":22948291,"type":"header","credit":"Kevin C.

Still, it will be difficult to dislodge Ayton from atop this perch, and there is a great deal of need for a dominant center on Phoenix's roster as well, with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2596107/alex-len\">Alex Len<\/a> entering unrestricted free agency and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/984/tyson-chandler\">Tyson Chandler<\/a> nearing the end of his career.<\/p>\n<p>The Suns were the worst defensive team in the NBA last year, and Ayton (or Doncic) won't provide immediate relief in that area, which could make Jackson or even Mohamed Bamba possibilities to consider should they slip on lottery night. --\u00a0<em>Givony<\/em><\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mem/memphis-grizzlies\">Memphis Grizzlies<\/a> | Likely spot: No. 2<\/h2>\n<p><strong>No. 1 pick odds: <\/strong>19.9 percent | <strong>Top-3 pick odds: <\/strong>55.8 percent<\/p>\n<p><em>If they land in the top three, they should pick ...<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No. 1:<\/strong> Luka Doncic<\/li>\n<li><strong>No. 2:<\/strong> Deandre Ayton<\/li>\n<li><strong>No. 3:<\/strong> Jaren Jackson Jr.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Most likely pick:<\/strong> Luka Doncic | G | Real Madrid<\/p>\n<p>The Grizzlies' ownership situation <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23101658/memphis-grizzlies-valued-13-billion-14-billion-robert-pera-deal\">finally being resolved<\/a> brings some clarity to their long-term outlook, but it creates a new set of questions considering the hefty price majority owner Robert Pera was forced to pay. With nearly $200 million owed to their aging core of <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3206/marc-gasol\">Marc Gasol<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3195/mike-conley\">Mike Conley<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6466/chandler-parsons\">Chandler Parsons<\/a>, it's unclear whether the Grizzlies can stomach the extended rebuilding process that this roster likely requires.<\/p>\n<p>All this could make Doncic, clearly the most productive, experienced and accomplished player in the draft, significantly more attractive, especially considering his outstanding fit on the roster. Ayton's fit looks questionable -- though his trade value can't be underestimated -- but Jackson and Marvin Bagley II are intriguing fits alongside Gasol, as bigger lineups have proven they can be effective in this year's playoffs (just look at the Celtics). --\u00a0<em>Givony<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/dal/dallas-mavericks\">Dallas Mavericks<\/a> | Likely spot: No. 3<\/h2>\n<p><strong>No. 1 pick odds:<\/strong> 13.8 percent | <strong>Top-3 pick odds:<\/strong> 42.6 percent<\/p>\n<p><inline1><\/p>\n<p><em>If they land in the top three, they should pick ...<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No. 1:<\/strong> Deandre Ayton<\/li>\n<li><strong>No. 2: <\/strong>Luka Doncic<\/li>\n<li><strong>No. 3: <\/strong>Jaren Jackson Jr.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Most likely pick:<\/strong> Jaren Jackson Jr. | C | Michigan State<\/p>\n<p>With\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/609/dirk-nowitzki\">Dirk Nowitzki<\/a>\u00a0turning 40 and committed to returning for what might be his final NBA season, the Mavericks may be straddling between giving the Hall of Famer a proper goodbye and fully committing to a necessary rebuild. Either Ayton or Doncic would look great in a Mavericks uniform, but should Dallas stand pat (or move down) it will likely be picking between a quartet of big men in Jackson, Bagley, Bamba and Wendell Carter Jr.<\/p>\n<p>While Jackson is likely the best two-way prospect in the draft, Bagley is an intriguing fit here as well considering his productivity and the potential of building a roster around his strengths and weaknesses. It's hard to win in today's NBA without a defensive anchor, which is what gives Jackson the slight edge for now. --\u00a0<em>Givony<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks\">Atlanta Hawks<\/a> | Likely spot: No. 4<\/h2>\n<p><strong>No. 1 pick odds:<\/strong> 13.7 percent | <strong>Top-3 pick odds: <\/strong>42.6 percent<\/p>\n<p><em>If they land in the top three, they should pick ...<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No. 1:<\/strong> Deandre Ayton<\/li>\n<li><strong>No. 2:<\/strong> Luka Doncic<\/li>\n<li><strong>No. 3:<\/strong> Jaren Jackson Jr.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Most likely pick:<\/strong> Marvin Bagley III | PF/C | Duke<\/p>\n<p>The Hawks parting ways with Mike Budenholzer is another sign that their rebuilding process is still at an early stage, indicating that existing pieces and roster needs won't be as much of a consideration as it might be elsewhere in the lottery.<\/p>\n<p>The big-man trio of Jackson, Bagley and Bamba look like safe bets for heavy consideration depending on where this pick falls, but Trae Young can't be ruled out either. --\u00a0<em>Givony<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic\">Orlando Magic<\/a> | Likely spot: No. 5<\/h2>\n<p><strong>No. 1 pick odds: <\/strong>8.8 percent | <strong>Top-3 pick odds: <\/strong>29.1 percent<\/p>\n<p><em>If they land in the top three, they should pick ...<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No. 1:<\/strong> Deandre Ayton<\/li>\n<li><strong>No. 2:<\/strong> Luka Doncic<\/li>\n<li><strong>No. 3:<\/strong> Jaren Jackson Jr.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Most likely pick:<\/strong> Mohamed Bamba | C | Texas<\/p>\n<p>Orlando's clogged salary cap limits flexibility in the immediate future, making team needs and roster fit a slightly more pressing issue. With that said, their highly experienced front office was hired last summer on long-term deals and finally has a chance to shape the direction of the team with the help of a new head coach. There are pressing issues to be addressed in the backcourt, where long-term starter <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2583639/elfrid-payton\">Elfrid Payton<\/a> was shipped off at the trade deadline, and in the frontcourt, where there appears to be a glut of ill-fitting pieces signed to long-term contracts by the previous regime.<\/p>\n<p>Jumping into the top three would be immensely helpful in that process, but expect the Magic to take a long-term view regardless of where they end up. Bamba has huge upside if they stand pat, while Carter would be the safe pick if they get bumped back and he also fits in nicely alongside their existing pieces. Young is certainly someone they'll need to look at as well. --\u00a0<em>Givony<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls\">Chicago Bulls<\/a> | Likely spot: No. 6<\/h2>\n<p><strong>No. 1 pick odds: <\/strong>5.3 percent | <strong>Top-3 pick odds: <\/strong>18.3 percent<\/p>\n<p><em>If they land in the top three, they should pick ...<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No. 1:<\/strong> Deandre Ayton<\/li>\n<li><strong>No. 2:<\/strong> Luka Doncic<\/li>\n<li><strong>No. 3:<\/strong> Jaren Jackson Jr.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Most likely pick:<\/strong> Wendell Carter Jr. | C | Duke<\/p>\n<p>An encouraging season showed that Chicago might not be as far away as originally thought, likely pushing the Bulls outside of the top five in this draft but also indicating there are some pieces worth building around, specifically <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991139/kris-dunn\">Kris Dunn<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066336/lauri-markkanen\">Lauri Markkanen<\/a>. Finding a bigger wing as well as a big man to pair with Markkanen seem to be the most immediate priorities moving forward.<\/p>\n<p>Moving into the top three would help that immensely considering how well the best prospects in this draft fit with the Chicago roster. Bamba and Carter look like the top big-man candidates, provided the Bulls don't move up, while Miles and Mikal Bridges are strong wing options. --\u00a0<em>Givony<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sac/sacramento-kings\">Sacramento Kings<\/a> | Likely spot: No. 7<\/h2>\n<p><strong>No. 1 pick odds: <\/strong>5.3 percent | <strong>Top-3 pick odds:<\/strong> 18.3 percent<\/p>\n<p><em>If they land in the top three, they should pick ...<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No. 1: <\/strong>Deandre Ayton<\/li>\n<li><strong>No. 2: <\/strong>Luka Doncic<\/li>\n<li><strong>No. 3:<\/strong> Jaren Jackson Jr.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Most likely pick:<\/strong> Michael Porter Jr. | SF/PF | Missouri<\/p>\n<p>The Kings showed progress this season and appear to have some strong building blocks in place, particularly in the backcourt.

Porter -- and to a lesser extent Miles Bridges -- are two players to think about if the top-tier big men such as Carter and Bamba are off the board. --\u00a0<em>Givony<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers<\/a> (via Nets) | Likely spot: No. 8<\/h2>\n<p><strong>No. 1 pick odds: <\/strong>2.8 percent | <strong>Top-3 pick odds: <\/strong>9.9 percent<\/p>\n<p><em>If they land in the top three, they should pick ...<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No. 1: <\/strong>Deandre Ayton<\/li>\n<li><strong>No. 2: <\/strong>Luka Doncic<\/li>\n<li><strong>No. 3: <\/strong>Jaren Jackson Jr.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Most likely pick:<\/strong> Trae Young | PG | Oklahoma<\/p>\n<p>Cleveland's sweep of Toronto and the renewed chemistry that appears to have been forged between <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james\">LeBron James<\/a> and the rest of the roster seems to bode well for their prospects of keeping the NBA's most dominant player.<\/p>\n<p>Continuing to stockpile young talent that the King is excited about certainly wouldn't hurt their pitch, and it just so happens that one of the most talented players in the draft could be sitting here at No. 8. Young plays a huge position of need for this squad, which has cycled through more than a half dozen guard options over the course of the season. If Young is gone, one of the many frontcourt options -- such as Carter, Bamba, either Bridges or Porter -- could also be attractive. --\u00a0<em>Givony<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks\">New York Knicks<\/a> | Likely spot: No. 9<\/h2>\n<p><strong>No. 1 pick odds:<\/strong> 1.7 percent | <strong>Top-3 pick odds: <\/strong>6.1 percent<\/p>\n<p><em>If they land in the top three, they should pick ...<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No. 1:<\/strong> Deandre Ayton<\/li>\n<li><strong>No. 2: <\/strong>Luka Doncic<\/li>\n<li><strong>No. 3:<\/strong> Jaren Jackson Jr.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Most likely pick: <\/strong>Collin Sexton | PG | Alabama<\/p>\n<p><alsosee><\/p>\n<p>With the growing realization that <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4230547/frank-ntilikina\">Frank Ntilikina<\/a> is best as a defensive-minded off guard, the Knicks and newly-appointed head coach David Fizdale could use a PG of the future to put pressure on the rim and form a 1-2 scoring punch with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3102531/kristaps-porzingis\">Kristaps Porzingis<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Sexton is an ideal candidate as one of the draft's best penetrators with the burst to dice up defenses and the mentality to thrive in New York City.

The real topic teams are pondering is whether Doncic projects as a franchise building block or a high-end starter on a really good team.<\/p>\n<p>Here's the skinny on his game:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modern perimeter player with a versatile skill set; best skills are unleashed when he has the ball in his hands<\/li>\n<li>Electric attacking rebounds and pushing tempo in the open floor<\/li>\n<li>Pick-and-roll tactician who dissects help defenses with cross-court darts and high-velocity hook passes<\/li>\n<li>More effective shooter off the bounce (69th percentile) than off the catch (48th percentile), regularly creating space to get to his patented step-back going left<\/li>\n<li>Dances on the perimeter against switches, lulling bigs to sleep before pulling up<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>On the flip side:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/22114864/is-luka-doncic-losing-grasp-no-1-pick-2018-nba-draft\" target=\"_blank\">Struggles mightily<\/a> as the primary ball handler without much backcourt help<\/li>\n<li>Had issues against aggressive defensive pressure all season<\/li>\n<li>Doesn't have the wiggle to break down rangier athletes consistently, and easily slowed by hard hedges and switches from agile bigs<\/li>\n<li>At 6-foot-8, 228 pounds, he's at his best defending wings instead of guards<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With that in mind, how exactly do you unleash Doncic offensively?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transition igniter<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Have Doncic attack defensive rebounds and push tempo. Through 61 games this season, he is scoring 1.34 points per possession on 82 chances as the transition ball handler, and he's an even more dynamic open-floor playmaker than scorer.<\/p>\n<p><inline1-wide><\/p>\n<p><strong>On-the-move shot creator<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The key is to get Doncic going to his right out of the pick-and-roll after the defense is already shifting, as he looks heavy-footed creating from a standstill against a set defense. Use a veteran point guard to bring the ball up the floor, then get Doncic into a ball screen with momentum to his right so he can use his size and elite vision to pick teams apart.<\/p>\n<p><inline2-wide><\/p>\n<p>Doncic is also a skilled pick-and-roll scorer (85th percentile), beating defenders going under screens by launching deep pull-ups, getting into midrange spots and finishing with slowdown floaters or crafty touch.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Off-ball value<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Doncic becomes quite ordinary if you stick him in the corner, as he isn't a knockdown spot shooter or an overly active cutter. But he's capable enough off the catch for teams to have to close out, and he's instinctual attacking from there. He's an excellent passer against scrambling defenses, and he has value as a screener given his size and ability to punish smalls in the post.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What does he need around him?<\/h2>\n<p>Think about how the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets\">Houston Rockets<\/a> use <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden\">James Harden<\/a> -- traditional PG in <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2779/chris-paul\">Chris Paul<\/a>, a pair of two-way wings in <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3033/pj-tucker\">PJ Tucker<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2426/trevor-ariza\">Trevor Ariza<\/a> plus an athletic 5 in <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3102529/clint-capela\">Clint Capela<\/a>. Harden also plays as the more ball-dominant guard for stretches next to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3431/eric-gordon\">Eric Gordon<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While Doncic is no Harden athletically, this is a good model to unlock his skills:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1.

Here's how well he fits with each one:<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns\">Phoenix Suns<\/a> | Top-2 odds: 46.5 percent<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Value proposition:<\/strong> Kokoskov relationship + <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136193/devin-booker\">Devin Booker<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Backcourt mate:<\/strong>\u00a0Booker, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3136194/tyler-ulis\">Tyler Ulis<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Two-way wing: <\/strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066297/josh-jackson\">Josh Jackson<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2982334/tj-warren\">TJ Warren<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Modern forward/big:<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4011991/dragan-bender\">Dragan Bender<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Roller: <\/strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3907487/marquese-chriss\">Marquese Chriss<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/984/tyson-chandler\">Tyson Chandler<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The hiring of Igor Kokoskov as head coach is a home run for Doncic and his development if he lands in Phoenix. Kokoskov is a creative offensive mind who knows how to unlock Doncic's strengths, as he showed coaching Slovenia to the EuroBasket gold medal.<\/p>\n<p>Playing next to a shot creator like Booker would bode well in some respects. However, Doncic would benefit from having a bit more experience and point-guard savvy in that spot. While accomplished, the 21-year-old Booker is still developing his on-ball game and is much more of a shot-making scorer at this stage. Defensively, Doncic and Booker will have their challenges.<\/p>\n<p>Phoenix lacks a degree of spacing with Jackson (26.3 percent from 3 this season), Warren (22.2 percent) and Chriss (29.5 percent) on the perimeter, but Jackson and Warren could run with Doncic in transition. Bender is also an interesting fit, should the Croatian continue to make strides as a shooter. With <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2596107/alex-len\">Alex Len<\/a> hitting free agency and Chandler toward the end of his career, the Suns don't quite have that dynamic lob-catcher.<\/p>\n<p>A young trio of Doncic, Booker and Jackson (and potentially Bender, pending improvement) is intriguing, but Phoenix would have to work on acquiring more veteran ballhandling, shooting and athleticism up front over the next few years. And entering a rebuild would be an adjustment after all of his European success.<\/p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mem/memphis-grizzlies\">Memphis Grizzlies<\/a> | Top-2 odds: 38.7 percent<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Value proposition:<\/strong> Fit with Conley + win-now timeline<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Backcourt mate:<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3195/mike-conley\">Mike Conley<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>3-and-D wing: <\/strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3155526/dillon-brooks\">Dillon Brooks<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3059316/wayne-selden\">Wayne Selden<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Modern forward/big:<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6466/chandler-parsons\">Chandler Parsons<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2327577/jamychal-green\">JaMychal Green<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Roller: <\/strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3206/marc-gasol\">Marc Gasol<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3937101/deyonta-davis\">Deyonta Davis<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doncic would be able to contribute right away while gradually earning more and more offensive volume. Will Conley, who spent more than 42 percent of his offense in pick-and-roll during his last healthy season, be willing to play more off the ball? If he's comfortable sliding over, this would make the most functional backcourt of any of these Doncic hopefuls.<\/p>\n<p>Outside of maybe Davis in time, Memphis doesn't have a dynamic roller for Doncic to spoon-feed. Gasol isn't an explosive big, but he provides floor spacing at the 5 while also operating as a plus playmaker from all over the floor. Defensively, they're a troublesome pick-and-roll pairing. Brooks is capable of filling the 3-and-D wing role and Parsons, if healthy, is a good fit at the 4 in modern lineups.<\/p>\n<p>If Memphis' core were younger there could be worries about the 19-year-old getting enough on-ball opportunities, but ushering him in with veterans is one of his best options. The Grizzlies are short on athletes and versatile defenders, and their young talent isn't quite as plentiful as other teams at the top of this draft, but the immediate fit and long-term benefit of playing next to Conley makes Memphis arguably the most attractive destination from a basketball standpoint.<\/p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/dal/dallas-mavericks\">Dallas Mavericks<\/a> | Top-2 odds: 27.9 percent<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Value proposition: <\/strong>Carlisle system + veteran role players<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Backcourt mate:<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4065697/dennis-smith-jr\">Dennis Smith Jr.<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3055/jj-barea\">J.J.

Doncic has also proved successful alongside the Barea of Spain, Facundo Campazzo, during his time with Real Madrid.<\/p>\n<p>Barea and Nowitzki offer veteran leadership as Doncic learns the NBA ropes. Veterans Matthews and Barnes will also ease his transition while bringing some defensive versatility. Should he re-sign, McDermott is an excellent spacer and on-the-move shooter. Powell led the NBA in field goal percentage in the paint and he's one of the game's more underrated rollers while possessing some agility defensively.<\/p>\n<p>This isn't an ideal fit given Smith's struggling defense and uninspiring off-ball play as well as Barnes' sometimes iso-happy preference, but there's certainly enough to work with here.<\/p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks\">Atlanta Hawks<\/a> | Top-2 odds: 27.9 percent<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Value proposition:<\/strong> Fit with Prince + Collins<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Backcourt mate:<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3032979/dennis-schroder\">Dennis Schroder<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>3-and-D wing:<\/strong> Taurean Prince, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6637/kent-bazemore\">Kent Bazemore<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3062667/deandre'-bembry\">DeAndre' Bembry<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Modern forward/big:<\/strong> Prince<\/li>\n<li><strong>Roller: <\/strong>John Collins, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2580913/dewayne-dedmon\">Dewayne Dedmon<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2490089/mike-muscala\">Mike Muscala<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doncic pairs nicely with Atlanta's most valuable building blocks in Prince and Collins. Prince can fill the wing role while also being able to slide up a spot, giving Doncic an excellent spot-up target as he ranks in the 88th percentile in catch-and-shoot efficiency, per Synergy. Prince is also at least capable of checking the opponent's best wing. Collins finished 20th in the NBA in transition scoring efficiency, and his athleticism and energy are ideal for Doncic at the 5. On the other end, Collins has the feet to switch ball screens, even if he's not yet the most reliable pick-and-roll defender and doesn't quite provide the necessary rim protection.<\/p>\n<p>The one young Hawks piece who doesn't fit all that well is Schroder, who is on the books for $46.5 million over the next three years but might not be a part of Atlanta's long-term plans. His breakdown speed and shot creation work next to a more methodical Doncic, but he needs the ball to be effective because of his limitations as a shooter. Schroder has underwhelmed defensively as well, finishing in the bottom five among point guards in ESPN's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/RPM\" target=\"_blank\">defensive real plus-minus<\/a> four out of his past five seasons.<\/p>\n<p>Lacking the ideal backcourt mate could lead to some lumps early in Doncic's career if he's saddled with too much shot-creation responsibility. But with plenty of draft picks coming, the Hawks are in a solid position to add more young pieces. Finding the guard to unlock Doncic's strengths will be key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/orl/orlando-magic\">Orlando Magic<\/a> | Top-2 odds: 18.5 percent<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Value proposition:<\/strong> Versatile athletes in Gordon/Isaac + vet presence<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Backcourt mate: <\/strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3415/dj-augustin\">D.J.

Fournier gives shooting on the wing and another perimeter creator. Simmons is a two-way wing and a veteran presence. Augustin and Mack are suitable stopgaps in the backcourt for now -- and they wouldn't interfere with Doncic's creative freedom -- but the Magic would need to find a long-term option to fill that spot, and it remains to be seen which guards they're committed to long-term. Doncic has had success with a Biyombo-like big in the past (Edy Tavares), and he could also mesh with a more skilled center in Vucevic. His best bet in the frontcourt might actually be Birch, who shined in the EuroLeague as an agile finisher.<\/p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sac/sacramento-kings\">Sacramento Kings<\/a> | Top-2 odds: 11.3 percent<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Value proposition: <\/strong>Dynamic ball handlers + agile bigs<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Backcourt mate: <\/strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066259/de'aaron-fox\">De'Aaron Fox<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3037789/bogdan-bogdanovic\">Bogdan Bogdanovic<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3059315/frank-mason-iii\">Frank Mason<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2990984/buddy-hield\">Buddy Hield<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Two-way wing:<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3138156/justin-jackson\">Justin Jackson<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4023/garrett-temple\">Garrett Temple<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6468/iman-shumpert\">Iman Shumpert<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Modern forward/big: <\/strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3936296/skal-labissiere\">Skal Labissiere<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Roller:<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991282/willie-cauley-stein\">Willie Cauley-Stein<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4065649/harry-giles\">Harry Giles<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1017/zach-randolph\">Zach Randolph<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The ultra-twitchy Fox is still quite green and not comfortable off the ball yet, but he projects as a plus defender and has the necessary breakdown tools.

Although he hasn't come close to maximizing his potential, Cauley-Stein -- entering a contract year -- is an ideal 5 for Doncic when engaged. The Kings staff raves about Giles, who can also fill that dynamic roller spot when healthy.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, though, the Kings are still finding their direction long-term, and Doncic could take time adjusting.<\/p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls\">Chicago Bulls<\/a> | Top-2 odds: 11.3 percent<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Value proposition: <\/strong>Shooting + potential fit with young core<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Backcourt mate: <\/strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2991139/kris-dunn\">Kris Dunn<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064440/zach-lavine\">Zach LaVine<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064230/cameron-payne\">Cameron Payne<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2531047/jerian-grant\">Jerian Grant<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Two-way wing:<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2284101/justin-holiday\">Justin Holiday<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/2999549/denzel-valentine\">Denzel Valentine<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Modern forward/big:<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066336/lauri-markkanen\">Lauri Markkanen<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3064482/bobby-portis\">Bobby Portis<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3893023/paul-zipser\">Paul Zipser<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Roller:<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3447/robin-lopez\">Robin Lopez<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3113587/cristiano-felicio\">Cristiano Felicio<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Can Doncic mesh with Dunn? Dunn is extremely ball-dominant, with 47.8 percent of his offense coming in the pick-and-roll last season, but he's also the hard-nosed, versatile defender Doncic needs. Plus, his dynamic athleticism on offense helps. The Bulls would need to make sure to find a balance between the two in terms of usage, and Dunn still needs to limit his turnovers and improve his off-ball play, but there's potential for the two to coexist. Should LaVine re-sign, he (along with Holiday and Valentine) would add value off the ball.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe the best fit of all would be Doncic and Markkanen, at least offensively. Markkanen is an ideal pop man and floor-spacer for the ball-screen wizard. Both Doncic and Markkanen will have to improve their ability to beat switches and defend ball screens on the other end. But when Dunn sits, the Bulls could trot out a lineup with shooting at all five positions, with Markkanen at the 4 and Portis at the 5. Doncic doesn't quite have a springy roller, but Lopez and Felicio are serviceable for the time being.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the Bulls lack a degree of veteran leadership and winning culture at the moment, but as long as they don't let Dunn pound the ball on the perimeter, there's potential for the marriage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n"},{"feedDisplayType":"Default","description":"Who are the best prospects in the 2018 NBA draft?

The list of participants remains fluid, with several alternates waiting for last-minute invites as prospects elect to withdraw from the competitive action or the entire event.<\/p>\n<p>While it's interesting to note which players will be in attendance, it is often just as notable to observe which players are not on the list. Because the NBA strives to invite the best prospects possible, the list gives us a pretty decent idea of which players are considered likely to be selected on draft night.<\/p>\n<p><offer><\/offer><\/p>\n<p>Of course, there are always outliers who get drafted without combine invites, such as Josh Richardson, Sterling Brown and Darrun Hilliard in recent years. The ultimate outlier: Oklahoma City Thunder wing Josh Huestis, who starred at the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament but didn't get invited to Chicago and ended up getting picked in the first round.<alsosee><\/p>\n<p>Players who will attempt to join that list in 2018 include <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3132042/gary-clark\">Gary Clark<\/a> (<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/21307077/nba-draft-rankings-espn-top-100-prospects-2018\">No. 62 in the ESPN 100<\/a>), <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3136989/vincent-edwards\">Vincent Edwards<\/a> (No. 76), <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/66427/mikyle-mcintosh\">MiKyle McIntosh<\/a> (No. 80) and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3138154/theo-pinson\">Theo Pinson<\/a> (No. 89).<\/p>\n<p>This year, only two players have willingly elected to decline invites to the combine: <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4278129/deandre-ayton\">Deandre Ayton<\/a> (No. 1) and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4066211/robert-williams\">Robert Williams<\/a> (No. 13). That's the fewest elite prospects to turn down invites since 2009, but expect this number to rise as we get closer to May 16. Still, the fact that the NBA elected to hold the draft lottery on the day before the combine (and invite 15 elite prospects to attend the draw) likely helped combat the trend of top players skipping the event altogether.<\/p>\n<p>There are 15 international players in our Top 100 still competing in-season with their teams, making them unable to participate in Chicago, including Luka Doncic (No. 2), Dzanan Musa (No. 20), Elie Okobo (No. 39) and Rodions Kurucs (No. 41).<\/p>\n<p>Eight underclassmen in our Top 100 (mostly in the Nos. 70-100 range) who have yet to hire agents were not invited, perhaps a sign that NBA teams think they need to return to school for another year. That includes Florida's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3147503/jalen-hudson\">Jalen Hudson<\/a> (No. 45), St. John's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4065834/shamorie-ponds\">Shamorie Ponds<\/a> (No. 63), Purdue's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4066407/carsen-edwards\">Carsen Edwards<\/a> (No. 71), Texas' Kerwin Roach (No. 72) and Iowa State's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4277887/lindell-wigginton\">Lindell Wigginton<\/a> (No. 73). These players can still conduct NBA team workouts prior to the combine and in the 10 days after the event concludes, giving them a last chance to gather feedback before they likely decide to return to school.<\/p>\n<p>Three underclassmen in our Top 100 who weren't invited to Chicago have already indicated their intent to hire agents and forgo NCAA eligibility: Louisville's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3908806/ray-spalding\">Ray Spalding<\/a> (No. 59), Texas A&M's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3947073/dj-hogg\">DJ Hogg<\/a> (No. 68) and Wake Forest's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3908843/doral-moore\">Doral Moore<\/a> (No. 91). Their road to the NBA is far from over, but this is certainly an unexpected hurdle. Other notable underclassmen who have already hired agents but weren't invited: <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3919334/lagerald-vick\">Lagerald Vick<\/a> (Kansas), <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3908807/deng-adel\">Deng Adel<\/a> (Louisville), <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3914285/drew-eubanks\">Drew Eubanks<\/a> (Oregon State), <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3138209/terry-larrier\">Terry Larrier<\/a> (UConn), <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3922235/robert-franks\">Robert Franks<\/a> (Washington State), <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4066250/mustapha-heron\">Mustapha Heron<\/a> (Auburn) and LiAngelo Ball (UCLA/Vytautas). Four players on our Top 100 are injured and unable to participate: SMU's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3915194/jarrey-foster\">Jarrey Foster<\/a> (No. 56), Notre Dame's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3138192/bonzie-colson\">Bonzie Colson<\/a> (No. 86), Texas Tech's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3133629/keenan-evans\">Keenan Evans<\/a> (No. 90) and Purdue's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3136990/isaac-haas\">Isaac Haas<\/a> (No. 99).<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we would be remiss not to mention the four players who are not on the ESPN 100 who have been invited to participate at the NBA combine: Kansas' <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4066299/udoka-azubuike\">Udoka Azubuike<\/a>, Georgia's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3136183/yante-maten\">Yante Maten<\/a>, UCLA's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4278526/jaylen-hands\">Jaylen Hands<\/a> and Maryland's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4277952/bruno-fernando\">Bruno Fernando<\/a>. Clearly NBA teams see them as better prospects than we do, and they will all be entering the ESPN Top 100 in the next update.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><inline1-wide><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n"},{"originallyPosted":"2018-05-07T16:08:00Z","images":[{"alt":"Allonzo Trier and Deandre Ayton","width":608,"name":"Allonzo Trier and Deandre Ayton

He averaged 12.9 points and 10.5 rebounds while ranking second nationally in blocks at 3.7 per game. Bamba totaled 15 double-doubles, including eight during an 11-game stretch in January and February.<\/p>\n<p>\"I don't want to take away from anything from my time at Texas,\" he told ESPN host Rachel Nichols and analysts Byron Scott and Tracy McGrady. \"I think it was actually pretty darn special. The relationships that I've built there, and the people that I've come across, I met some of my best friends in life at the University of Texas.\"<\/p>\n<p>Bamba has been considered a top-five pick since the preseason, and he slots in at No. 5 in <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/22726756/2018-nba-mock-draft-deandre-ayton-luka-doncic-trae-young-more\">Jonathan Givony's latest ESPN mock draft<\/a>.\u00a0He missed three games late in the season with a toe injury, but he returned to put up 13 points, 14 rebounds and three blocks during a first-round NCAA tournament loss to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2440/nevada-wolf-pack\">Nevada<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\"It would have taken my game to the next level,\" Bamba said of a jump to the NBA out of high school. \"Because now, what's so night and day between being a college student-athlete, is that you got to split up times for different things -- all right, now I have to actually study and write this essay; I have to crank it out because it's due tomorrow at 10 a.m.<\/p>\n<p>\"But now, I'm literally, the only thing I'm studying is myself. I'm really, like, fully invested in my body, and I'm really liking this professional thing.\"<\/p>\n<p>When asked what it would mean to be drafted by his hometown\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks\">New York Knicks<\/a>, the Harlem native indicated he hasn't tempered his expectations.<\/p>\n<p>\"That's funny,\" Bamba replied. \"I didn't know the Knicks were in contention to be the No. 1 pick.\"<\/p>\n<p>The Knicks indeed hold only a 1.7 percent chance of landing the top pick in next month's draft lottery, with the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns\">Phoenix Suns<\/a> (25 percent), <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mem/memphis-grizzlies\">Memphis Grizzlies<\/a> (19.9), <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/dal/dallas-mavericks\">Dallas Mavericks<\/a> (13.8) and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks\">Atlanta Hawks<\/a>\u00a0(13.7) having the top odds.<\/p>\n<p>\"It honestly would mean the world to me -- I grew up watching the Knicks,\" Bamba said. \"I watched the Knicks when they were at their worst, and I would always root for them because it's always been in my heart. It would be awesome, you know. I live three train stops from there.\"<\/p>\n<p>Bamba recently spent a week working out with\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3059318/joel-embiid\">Joel Embiid<\/a> while the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-76ers\">Philadelphia 76ers<\/a>\u00a0center worked back into shape after fracturing his eye socket and sustaining a concussion.<\/p>\n<p>\"He's the guy I really want to play against,\" Bamba said. \"I learned so much from him in just a couple of days of being around him. He's a guy I'm really inspired to be like, and he's the guy I want to go at.\"<\/p>\n<p>Bamba said his game fits into what the NBA is looking for -- \"guys who can really stretch the floor out at the 5, but be elite rim protectors who can guard the 1 through 5 positions,\" and that in the five weeks since he has been preparing for the draft, he has been working on developing the mechanics of his outside jump shot.<\/p>\n<p>\"Making sure that my jump shot resembled more of a jump shot -- you know, everything was smooth -- rather than a catapult,\" Bamba said. \"I recently lowered my pocket, and my follow-through looks good and everything is smooth. I still got ways to go with my jump shot. But I'm pretty happy with the progression that I've made.\"<\/p>\n<p><em>Information from ESPN's Jeff Borzello and ESPN Stats & Information was used in this

He averaged 12.9 points and 10.5 rebounds while ranking second nationally in blocks at 3.7 per game. Bamba totaled 15 double-doubles, including eight during an 11-game stretch in January and February.<\/p>\n<p>\"I don't want to take away from anything from my time at Texas,\" he told ESPN host Rachel Nichols and analysts Byron Scott and Tracy McGrady. \"I think it was actually pretty darn special. The relationships that I've built there, and the people that I've come across, I met some of my best friends in life at the University of Texas.\"<\/p>\n<p>Bamba has been considered a top-five pick since the preseason, and he slots in at No. 5 in <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/22726756/2018-nba-mock-draft-deandre-ayton-luka-doncic-trae-young-more\">Jonathan Givony's latest ESPN mock draft<\/a>.\u00a0He missed three games late in the season with a toe injury, but he returned to put up 13 points, 14 rebounds and three blocks during a first-round NCAA tournament loss to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/2440/nevada-wolf-pack\">Nevada<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\"It would have taken my game to the next level,\" Bamba said of a jump to the NBA out of high school. \"Because now, what's so night and day between being a college student-athlete, is that you got to split up times for different things -- all right, now I have to actually study and write this essay; I have to crank it out because it's due tomorrow at 10 a.m.<\/p>\n<p>\"But now, I'm literally, the only thing I'm studying is myself. I'm really, like, fully invested in my body, and I'm really liking this professional thing.\"<\/p>\n<p>When asked what it would mean to be drafted by his hometown\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks\">New York Knicks<\/a>, the Harlem native indicated he hasn't tempered his expectations.<\/p>\n<p>\"That's funny,\" Bamba replied. \"I didn't know the Knicks were in contention to be the No. 1 pick.\"<\/p>\n<p>The Knicks indeed hold only a 1.7 percent chance of landing the top pick in next month's draft lottery, with the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phx/phoenix-suns\">Phoenix Suns<\/a> (25 percent), <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/mem/memphis-grizzlies\">Memphis Grizzlies<\/a> (19.9), <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/dal/dallas-mavericks\">Dallas Mavericks<\/a> (13.8) and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks\">Atlanta Hawks<\/a>\u00a0(13.7) having the top odds.<\/p>\n<p>\"It honestly would mean the world to me -- I grew up watching the Knicks,\" Bamba said. \"I watched the Knicks when they were at their worst, and I would always root for them because it's always been in my heart. It would be awesome, you know. I live three train stops from there.\"<\/p>\n<p>Bamba recently spent a week working out with\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3059318/joel-embiid\">Joel Embiid<\/a> while the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-76ers\">Philadelphia 76ers<\/a>\u00a0center worked back into shape after fracturing his eye socket and sustaining a concussion.<\/p>\n<p>\"He's the guy I really want to play against,\" Bamba said. \"I learned so much from him in just a couple of days of being around him. He's a guy I'm really inspired to be like, and he's the guy I want to go at.\"<\/p>\n<p>Bamba said his game fits into what the NBA is looking for -- \"guys who can really stretch the floor out at the 5, but be elite rim protectors who can guard the 1 through 5 positions,\" and that in the five weeks since he has been preparing for the draft, he has been working on developing the mechanics of his outside jump shot.<\/p>\n<p>\"Making sure that my jump shot resembled more of a jump shot -- you know, everything was smooth -- rather than a catapult,\" Bamba said. \"I recently lowered my pocket, and my follow-through looks good and everything is smooth. I still got ways to go with my jump shot. But I'm pretty happy with the progression that I've made.\"<\/p>\n<p><em>Information from ESPN's Jeff Borzello and ESPN Stats & Information was used in this report.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n"},{"images":[{"alt":"DeAndre Ayton","width":600,"name":"DeAndre Ayton [600x400]","peers":[{"alt":"DeAndre Ayton","width":1296,"name":"DeAndre Ayton [1296x1296]","id":22758893,"type":"header","credit":"Ethan Miller/Getty Images","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0314/r340825_1296x1296_1-1.jpg","height":1296},{"alt":"DeAndre Ayton","width":1296,"name":"DeAndre Ayton [1296x729]","id":22758885,"type":"header","credit":"Ethan Miller/Getty Images","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0314/r340825_1296x729_16-9.jpg","height":729},{"alt":"DeAndre Ayton","width":864,"name":"DeAndre Ayton [864x1296]","id":22758901,"type":"header","credit":"Ethan Miller/Getty Images","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0314/r340825_864x1296_2-3.jpg","height":1296},{"alt":"DeAndre Ayton","width":1296,"name":"DeAndre Ayton [1296x864]","id":22758897,"type":"header","credit":"Ethan Miller/Getty Images","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0314/r340825_1296x864_3-2.jpg","height":864},{"alt":"DeAndre Ayton","width":1296,"name":"DeAndre Ayton [1296x518]","id":22758890,"type":"header","credit":"Ethan Miller/Getty Images","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0314/r340825_1296x518_5-2.jpg","height":518}],"id":22758899,"type":"header","credit":"Ethan Miller/Getty Images","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0314/r340825_600x400_3-2.jpg","height":400}],"feedDisplayType":"Default","description":"Likely lottery picks Deandre Ayton and Marvin Bagley III were among the record 236 players on the NBA's official early-entry list, a significant leap from last year's total of 182.","section":"NBA Draft","categorized":"2018-04-25T00:07:48Z","linkText":"NBA's early-entry list shatters mark with 236","allowAMP":true,"published":"2018-04-25T00:07:48Z","type":"HeadlineNews","allowComments":true,"premium":false,"nowId":"1-23307754","related":[{"images":[{"alt":"Trae Young","width":608,"name":"Trae Young [608x342]","peers":[{"alt":"Trae Young","width":1296,"name":"Trae Young [1296x1296]","id":21850843,"type":"header","credit":"AP Photo/Tyler Drabek","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2017/1222/r305937_1296x1296_1-1.jpg","height":1296},{"alt":"Trae Young","width":1296,"name":"Trae Young [1296x729]","id":21850827,"type":"header","credit":"AP Photo/Tyler Drabek","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2017/1222/r305937_1296x729_16-9.jpg","height":729},{"alt":"Trae Young","width":864,"name":"Trae Young [864x1296]","id":21850832,"type":"header","credit":"AP Photo/Tyler Drabek","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2017/1222/r305937_864x1296_2-3.jpg","height":1296},{"alt":"Trae Young","width":1296,"name":"Trae Young [1296x864]","id":21850836,"type":"header","credit":"AP Photo/Tyler Drabek","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2017/1222/r305937_1296x864_3-2.jpg","height":864},{"alt":"Trae Young","width":1296,"name":"Trae Young [1296x518]","id":21850840,"type":"header","credit":"AP Photo/Tyler Drabek","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2017/1222/r305937_1296x518_5-2.jpg","height":518}],"id":21850829,"type":"header","credit":"AP Photo/Tyler Drabek","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2017/1222/r305937_608x342_16-9.jpg","height":342}],"premium":false,"description":"The NBA released to teams the list of 236 players that have filed as early entry candidates for the 2018 NBA draft.","linkText":"NBA draft: Every player who has declared early for 2018","links":{"web":{"href":"http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23306502/2018-nba-draft-every-player-declared-early"},"mobile":{"href":"http://m.espn.go.com/nba/story?storyId=23306502"},"api":{"news":{"href":"http://now.core.api.prod.espninfra.starwave.com/allsports/apis/v1/sports/news/23306502"},"self":{"href":"http://now.core.api.prod.espninfra.starwave.com/allsports/apis/v1/sports/news/23306502"}}},"id":23306502,"title":"2018 NBA draft - Every player who has declared early","type":"Story","headline":"NBA draft: Every player who has declared early for 2018"},{"images":[{"alt":"Hamidou Diallo","width":576,"name":"Buffalo vs. Kentucky (Hamidou Diallo) [576x324]","peers":[{"alt":"Hamidou Diallo","width":1296,"name":"Buffalo vs. Kentucky (Hamidou Diallo) [1296x1296]","id":22812146,"type":"header","credit":"Kevin C.

He made his professional basketball debut shortly after at the Euroleague qualifying tournament for VEF Riga but moved to Spain at the beginning of 2015.<\/p>\n<p><photo1><\/p>\n<p>Kurucs suffered some injuries that slowed his development and has yet to get his professional career fully on track. He entered the 2017 NBA draft against the wishes of Barcelona but was forced to withdraw at the deadline despite strong interest in the late first round, as his exorbitant buyout, which reportedly was around 4 million euros, would have made it difficult for him to have joined the NBA immediately. Kurucs has been embroiled in conflict since then due to his refusal to sign a contract extension with Barcelona. He has one year remaining on his deal.<\/p>\n<p>ESPN draft analyst Mike Schmitz was in Spain earlier this month and was able to get a better feel for Kurucs' situation, as well as his strengths and weaknesses as a prospect.<\/p>\n<p>\"Kurucs scored 16 first-half points, making shots from the perimeter and attacking the rim while also showing his shortcomings as a decision-maker and defender,\" Schmitz said. \"He's in a tough situation when he takes the floor in LEB Gold, as he often tries to do too much, anxious to prove himself. Kurucs is starting to get more consistent playing time with Barcelona II, though, seeing action in five of the last six games and averaging 23.4 points per 40 minutes on 63.6 percent from 2 and 35.3 percent from 3. Even so, the fact that Kurucs only practices with the first team and comes down with a score-first mentality has caused internal strife among his coaches and teammates.\"<\/p>\n<p>Kurucs, 20, is currently slated 39th in the latest ESPN mock draft. His combination of size, polished scoring instincts and multipositional versatility is attractive in today's NBA. As an international player who is making himself eligible for the second time, he would have one more opportunity to go through the NBA draft process should he withdraw his name at the early-entry deadline June 11.<\/p>\n<p>Kurucs' ability to attend private workouts or participate in the NBA International Elite Camp in Treviso in early June will likely play a significant role in his decision. Few teams have been able to scout him thoroughly, with many top decision-makers electing not to schedule trips to watch him due to the uncertainty of what team he'll be playing with on any given day and whether he'll see any minutes. Regardless, many scouts consider him to be the third-best international prospect in the draft and an attractive stash option for a team that is strapped for roster spots in the short term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n"},{"images":[{"alt":"Kevin Huerter, Trevon Bluiett","width":600,"name":"Kevin Huerter, Trevon Bluiett [600x400]","peers":[{"alt":"Kevin Huerter, Trevon Bluiett","width":1296,"name":"Kevin Huerter, Trevon Bluiett [1296x729]","id":18927376,"type":"header","credit":"Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2017/0316/r191003_1296x729_16-9.jpg","height":729},{"alt":"Kevin Huerter, Trevon Bluiett","width":1296,"name":"Kevin Huerter, Trevon Bluiett [1296x864]","id":18927381,"type":"header","credit":"Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2017/0316/r191003_1296x864_3-2.jpg","height":864},{"alt":"Kevin Huerter, Trevon Bluiett","width":1296,"name":"Kevin Huerter, Trevon Bluiett [1296x518]","id":18927385,"type":"header","credit":"Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2017/0316/r191003_1296x518_5-2.jpg","height":518}],"id":18927383,"type":"header","credit":"Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2017/0316/r191003_600x400_3-2.jpg","height":400}],"feedDisplayType":"Default","description":"Kevin Huerter, who averaged 14.8 points per game as a sophomore for Maryland, will enter the NBA draft and is a projected late-first-round pick.","section":"NBA Draft","categorized":"2018-04-20T18:08:39Z","linkText":"Terps' Huerter enters draft, won't hire agent","allowAMP":true,"published":"2018-04-20T18:08:39Z","type":"HeadlineNews","allowComments":true,"premium":false,"nowId":"1-23263286","related":[{"images":[{"width":608,"name":"McDonald's Boys All-American Game (Nassir Little) [608x342] - Copy","peers":[{"width":1296,"name":"McDonald's Boys All-American Game (Nassir Little) [1296x1296]","id":22948291,"type":"header","credit":"Kevin C.

DiVincenzo<\/a>, the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player, will declare for the NBA draft without hiring an agent in order to maintain his college eligibility.<\/p>\n<p>DiVencenzo, who came off the bench for the national champion Wildcats this past season, is expected to be a focal point next season with the losses of <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3934672/jalen-brunson\">Jalen Brunson<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3147657/mikal-bridges\">Mikal Bridges<\/a> -- who both announced they will leave early and forgo their remaining year of college eligibility. Wildcats big man <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4065836/omari-spellman\">Omari Spellman<\/a> also announced he will test the NBA's draft process, but hasn't signed with an agent.<\/p>\n<p><photo1><\/p>\n<p>DiVincenzo averaged 13.4 points and 4.8 rebounds this past season, and erupted for 31 points in the national title game victory over Michigan.<\/p>\n<p>\"Donte has consistently improved in his time at Villanova through dedication and a commitment to our core values,\" Villanova coach Jay Wright said in a statement on Thursday. \"His play this season has created a unique opportunity for him to receive feedback from NBA teams in the draft process. We support Donte fully and our staff will work together with him and his family to help him assess the next step in his basketball career.\"<\/p>\n<p>Multiple NBA executives told ESPN that DiVincenzo is a likely second-round pick who could slip into the latter part of the first round. He will likely be invited to the NBA draft combine in Chicago next month.<\/p>\n<p>Villanova announced that juniors <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3147656/phil-booth\">Phil Booth<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/3133817/eric-paschall\">Eric
