Tide coach Nick Saban had to hire five new assistant coaches, including both coordinators, after former offensive coordinator Brian Daboll left for the Buffalo Bills and former defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt was named Tennessee's new head coach. Outside linebackers coach Tosh Lupoi was promoted to defensive coordinator while receivers coach Mike Locksley was promoted to offensive coordinator.</p><p>Two other assistant coaches also departed: secondary coach Derrick Ansley (Oakland Raiders) and defensive line coach Karl Dunbar (Pittsburgh Steelers). Saban has hired four new assistants: former Arkansas offensive coordinator Dan Enos, Penn State receivers coach Josh Gattis, Texas Tech defensive backs coach Karl Scott and UTSA defensive backs coach Pete Golding. Saban still has one vacancy to fill.</p><p>The turnover was felt in Alabama's recruiting efforts. After signing the No. 1 class in six of the previous seven years, the Tide slipped to No. 6 this year, which was its worst finish since Saban's first season at Alabama.

Passing-game coordinator Ricky Rahne takes over playcalling duties from Moorhead and had an impressive debut in a 35-28 win over Washington in the PlayStation Fiesta Bowl.</p><p>Penn State's schedule gets a little more difficult in 2018, with games against Iowa, Michigan, Michigan State, Ohio State and Wisconsin, but the Nittany Lions will play all but the Wolverines in Happy Valley.</p><p><i>For more on how the Nittany Lions will look in 2018, check out <a href="http://insider.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/classrankings/rank/_/rank/4/class/2018/date/20180104" target="new">Penn State's recruiting profile<img alt="Insider" border="0" height="11" src="http://a.espncdn.com/i/in.gif" width="11"></a> and ESPN's <a href="http://insider.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/classrankings" target="new">class rankings</a>.</i></p><hr><h2>11. <a href="/college-football/team/_/id/130/michigan-wolverines" target="_new">Michigan</a></h2><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/130.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"><p><strong>Previous Way-Too-Early rank:</strong> 14<br />

After a 9-4 season in 2017 and a recruiting class that ranked No. 14 nationally, the Tigers' worst ranking since 2002, LSU fans are still waiting for results.</p><p>The Tigers were up and down in Orgeron's first season, beating Auburn and falling to Mississippi State (by 30 points), Troy (at home) and Notre Dame (in the Citrus Bowl). LSU's issues in 2017 were the same as they were under Miles: The Tigers struggled to pass the ball and score.</p><p>It won't be any easier in 2018, with six underclassmen turning pro, including Guice, Clapp and Weathersby. The Tigers have lost a whopping 31 underclassmen to the pros since 2013.</p><p>Orgeron made a change at offensive coordinator, parting ways with Matt Canada after one season and promoting tight ends coach Steve Ensminger to be Canada's replacement. At least LSU secured defensive coordinator Dave Aranda, who received a four-year, $10 million contract, the highest ever for an FBS assistant, after Texas A&M tried to hire him away.</p><p>The Tigers will play a nonconference game against Miami in Arlington, Texas, next season, along with road games at Auburn, Florida and Texas A&M.</p><p><i>For more on how the Tigers will look in 2018, check out <a href="http://insider.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/classrankings/rank/_/rank/11/class/2018/date/20180104" target="new">LSU's recruiting profile<img alt="Insider" border="0" height="11" src="http://a.espncdn.com/i/in.gif" width="11"></a> and ESPN's <a href="http://insider.espn.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/classrankings" target="new">class rankings</a>.</i></p><hr><h2>24. <a href="/college-football/team/_/id/251/texas-longhorns" target="_new">Texas</a></h2><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/251.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true" width="50"><p><strong>Previous Way-Too-Early rank:</strong> 24<br />
