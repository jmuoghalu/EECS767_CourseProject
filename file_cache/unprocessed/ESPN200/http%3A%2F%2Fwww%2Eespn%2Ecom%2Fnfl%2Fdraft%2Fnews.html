He had 8.5 sacks on a first-one-to-the-QB defense in 2017 and could do more damage in 2018.\n\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/264.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2>14. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3886808/trey-adams\">Trey Adams<\/a>, OT, Washington<\/h2>\nAdams has a huge 6-foot-8 frame and has been a very good left tackle since he was inserted early in his freshman season, but we'll need to see how well he works his way back from an ACL injury.\n\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2>15. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4035495/derrick-brown\">Derrick Brown<\/a>, DT, Auburn*<\/h2>\nLong and powerful at 6-foot-5 and 325 pounds, he's coming off a breakthrough campaign and could be truly dominating as a true junior. When a guy like this isn't one of the top couple of defensive tackles early on in the process, it shows the potential depth at the top of the D-line class.\n\n\n<p><photo3><\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/142.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2>16. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3924327/drew-lock\">Drew Lock<\/a>, QB, Missouri<\/h2>\n<p>Lock has a legit arm and quietly put up impressive totals for a team that faced a lot of good defenses. He had 44 touchdown passes and 13 INTs in 2017 and gets a chance to improve on those totals in 2018. NFL eyes will be watching.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2294.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2>17. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4036131/noah-fant\">Noah Fant<\/a>, TE, Iowa*<\/h2>\n<p>A move tight end, Fant has the big catch radius teams covet, with a 6-foot-5 frame, and he can run. You never expect a ton of targets in Iowa's offense, but I'd expect Fant to get a bump from his 30 catches in 2017 with improving QB play in Iowa City.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2483.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2>18. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert\">Justin Herbert<\/a>, QB, Oregon*<\/h2>\nAt 6-foot-6 and 230 pounds, Herbert has a big frame but is also an above-average athlete for a guy that size. He has completed over 65 percent of his passes and has a 34-9 TD-INT ratio over 16 games. Staying healthy could mean a breakout year in 2018.\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/275.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2>19. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3917660/david-edwards\">David Edwards<\/a>, OT, Wisconsin*<\/h2>\n<p>Rinse, repeat. The Wisconsin O-line production line is set to churn out another. Edwards has length (6-foot-7) and starting experience going back to his redshirt freshman season. Already an All-American, his developmental course has a fun foundation: He was a high school quarterback.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/201.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2>20. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3705353/rodney-anderson\">Rodney Anderson<\/a>, RB, Oklahoma*<\/h2>\n<p>An army of NFL scouts and GMs watched Baker Mayfield stare down Roquan Smith in the Rose Bowl. They also saw Anderson run for 201 yards against that vaunted Georgia defense. The 6-foot-2, 220-pounder has a great blend of speed, power and vision.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/103.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2>21. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3915282/zach-allen\">Zach Allen<\/a>, DE, Boston College<\/h2>\nThe 6-foot-5, 285-pound lineman has grown into a big-time prospect because not only can he rush the passer, he can play the run and fight through blocks to make plays. A lineman who can pile up 100 tackles while balancing pass-rush duty has a high floor.\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/9.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2>22.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4047839/n'keal-harry\">N'Keal Harry<\/a>, WR, Arizona State*<\/h2>\nAt 6-foot-4, Harry has a big catch radius, and has been a big target since he arrived in Tempe. He was a freshman All-American and took the added defensive attention in stride as a sophomore, piling up 82 catches. He can be dominant in the red zone, abusing smaller corners on jump balls.\n\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2483.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2>23. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3122692/jalen-jelks\">Jalen Jelks<\/a>, DE, Oregon<\/h2>\nAn athletic project upon arrival, Jelks has become a major prospect during his time in Eugene. At 6-foot-6 and 250-plus pounds, he has length and quickness and pass-rushing upside. He piled up 15.5 tackles for loss last season.\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/333.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2>24. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3925350/anfernee-jennings\">Anfernee Jennings<\/a>, OLB, Alabama*<\/h2>\nThe 6-foot-3, 262-pounder was enjoying a breakout season when he injured his knee in the College Football Playoff and had to shut it down. But expect a healthy version in 2018 as part of a loaded Bama defense.\n\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/344.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2>25. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3134690/montez-sweat\">Montez Sweat<\/a>, DE, Mississippi State<\/h2>\nOut of high school you'd have pegged Sweat as a tight end prospect if he made this list. Instead, the athletic, 6-foot-6 pass-rusher is coming off a 10.5-sack season and could be one of the best pass-rushers in the country in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n"},{"feedDisplayType":"Default","description":"Only 357 days until next year's draft begins.

emerges as leading contender to host 2019 NFL draft","story":"<p>Nashville, Tennessee, has emerged as the leading contender to host the 2019 NFL draft, league sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>A decision is expected to be announced during the league's spring meeting May 22-23 in Atlanta.<\/p>\n<p>In the unlikely event that Nashville were to lose out on the 2019 draft, the city would be in prime position to then host the 2020 event, sources told ESPN.<\/p>\n<p>The other cities being considered as the potential host sites for the 2019 and 2020 NFL drafts are Las Vegas, Denver, Kansas City and a combination bid from Cleveland/Canton, Ohio.<\/p>\n<p>Butch Spyridon, the president and CEO of the Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp., told ESPN's Cameron Wolfe on Wednesday that the city encouraged the NFL to use the Ascend Amphitheater for the draft theater, Nissan Stadium (home of the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ten/tennessee-titans\">Tennessee Titans<\/a>) and its parking lots for the fan experience, and the Schermerhorn Symphony Center for the Titans' war room.<\/p>\n<p>Spyridon suggested that Broadway Street and First Avenue -- which is full of honky-tonks and includes nearby Bridgestone Arena -- be a big part of draft weekend as well. He also presented the Music City Center convention hall as a potential option.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, the NFL will create its own event based on the potential locations provided.<\/p>\n<p>Officials were told the NFL wants the draft to take on the personality of the host city, and that's when Nashville's representatives felt their chances improved dramatically because of the city's music-centric, party vibe.<\/p>\n<p>Spyridon said Nashville's slight preference was to host the 2020 draft because of minor logistics, but the organizing group has the flexibility and desire to host the 2019 draft if that is the NFL's choice.<\/p>\n<p>Spyridon said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" that Nashville would land the draft, putting odds at much better than 50-50.<\/p>\n<p>\"If we can embrace it Nashville style, we got a shot,\" Spyridon said. \"It'd be a big party. You'd know you were in Nashville. I promise they wouldn't be disappointed.\"<\/p>\n<p>The first televised draft was broadcast by ESPN in 1980, but it wasn't a fan event until 1995, when the league moved it to Madison Square Garden in New York.<\/p>\n<p>After a nine-year run at Radio City Music Hall in New York ended in 2014, the draft has been held in Chicago (2015-16), Philadelphia (2017) and Arlington, Texas (2018).<\/p>\n<p>This year's event at AT&T Stadium, home of the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Dallas Cowboys<\/a>, was the first to be held inside an NFL stadium.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n"},{"images":[{"width":600,"name":"Baker Mayfield [600x400]","peers":[{"width":1296,"name":"Baker Mayfield [1296x1296]","id":21891809,"type":"header","credit":"AP Photo/Ron

You just evaluate the player and we think Danny has some decent traits and some decent qualities to work with, so we'll put him in our program and see how he does.\"<\/p>\n<p>As is the case for all seventh-round picks, the 6-foot-3, 222-pound Etling faces longer odds to emerge. As a senior at LSU in 2017, he went 165-of-275 passing for 2,463 yards, with 16 touchdowns and two interceptions (one was a Hail Mary).<\/p>\n<p>Etling is an older rookie, as he turns 24 in July, which is a result of having to sit out the 2015 season after transferring from Purdue to LSU. A native of Terre Haute, Indiana, who grew up an <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts\">Indianapolis Colts<\/a> fan, he was a coveted recruit out of high school. He started 12 games over two seasons at Purdue (2013-2014), losing the starting job, which led him to transfer.<\/p>\n<p>Etling said playing at LSU, under former NFL head coach/coordinator Cam Cameron in a pro-style offense, helped him progress. In addition, he said he has played in four different offensive systems under four coordinators, which has helped him adapt.<\/p>\n<p>Asked his strengths as a quarterback, he said, \"I'm just going to make sure that I'm always going to lead the offense, make sure that I understand that I'm the CEO when I'm out there on the field and move the chains, get the offense in the right play and be accurate with the football, and continue to improve always. Just making sure, some way, somehow, I'm always doing my job and to the best of my ability.\"<\/p>\n<p>Although he has never met Brady, Etling has a notable link to him from recently working with his throwing coach, Tom House.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n"},{"images":[{"width":600,"name":"Jordan Mailata [600x400]","peers":[{"width":1296,"name":"Jordan Mailata [1296x1296]","id":23349164,"type":"header","credit":"Doug Benc/AP Images","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0428/r363014_1296x1296_1-1.jpg","height":1296},{"width":1296,"name":"Jordan Mailata [1296x729]","id":23349148,"type":"header","credit":"Doug Benc/AP Images","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0428/r363014_1296x729_16-9.jpg","height":729},{"width":864,"name":"Jordan Mailata [864x1296]","id":23349153,"type":"header","credit":"Doug Benc/AP Images","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0428/r363014_864x1296_2-3.jpg","height":1296},{"width":1296,"name":"Jordan Mailata [1296x864]","id":23349157,"type":"header","credit":"Doug Benc/AP Images","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0428/r363014_1296x864_3-2.jpg","height":864},{"width":1296,"name":"Jordan Mailata [1296x518]","id":23349161,"type":"header","credit":"Doug Benc/AP Images","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0428/r363014_1296x518_5-2.jpg","height":518}],"id":23349159,"type":"header","credit":"Doug Benc/AP Images","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0428/r363014_600x400_3-2.jpg","height":400}],"feedDisplayType":"Default","description":"With their final pick of the 2018 NFL draft, the Eagles selected Jordan Mailata, a 6-foot-8, 346-pound offensive tackle prospect from Australia with no football experience.","section":"NFL","categorized":"2018-04-28T22:50:05Z","linkText":"Eagles take rugby leaguer with no football past","allowAMP":true,"published":"2018-04-28T22:50:05Z","type":"HeadlineNews","allowComments":true,"premium":false,"nowId":"1-23349066","related":[{"images":[{"alt":"Nick Foles and Carson Wentz","width":608,"name":"Nick Foles and Carson Wentz [608x342]","peers":[{"alt":"Nick Foles and Carson Wentz","width":1296,"name":"Nick Foles and Carson Wentz [1296x1296]","caption":"Quarterbacks Nick Foles and Carson Wentz were both a big part of why the Eagles won a championship.","id":22334372,"type":"header","credit":"TIMOTHY A.

Watch some of his rugby league tape for the South Sydney Rabbitohs, and you'll see a big, fast, athletic dynamo trucking his competition. It's to be determined how his transition to the gridiron will go, but the tools are obvious.<\/p>\n<p>His journey began last summer when his agent decided to create a highlight reel to try to entice any other rugby clubs. He also sent them to a connection with the NFL's International Player Pathway program, who was intrigued.<\/p>\n<p>A November workout in Los Angeles led to Mailata being selected to train at IMG in Florida. He has labored there for the past several months, averaging four-and-a-half hours a day of training and an additional three hours of board and film work to learn the game.<\/p>\n<p><inline1><\/p>\n<p>Asked about his knowledge of football before this program, Mailata said, \"Mate, as little as peanuts.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"The last three or four months have not been easy at all,\" he said. \"Mentally challenging as well as physically. Trying to understand the basics and the fundamentals of football has been a great task. Little knowledge before I came in, but I can happily say now that I can understand concepts and a beginning to have a step in the right direction.\"<\/p>\n<p>He held his own pro day at IMG. It was co-led by Eagles offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland, who Mailata felt was \"challenging my manhood\" with all that he asked of him.<\/p>\n<p>\"But he gave me the thumbs up at the end of the session and said I had an outstanding session, an outstanding workout,\" Mailata said.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>He earned Stoutland's respect throughout the process. The key is that Stoutland determined that he was coachable.<\/p>\n<p>Mailata ran a 5.12-second 40-yard dash at his pro day, which would have ranked eighth among offensive linemen at the combine. From there, seven teams brought him in for a visit: the Eagles, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/wsh/washington-redskins\">Washington Redskins<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns\">Cleveland Browns<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers\">Los Angeles Chargers<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-falcons\">Atlanta Falcons<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts\">Indianapolis Colts<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets<\/a>. Philly was the one that grabbed him.<\/p>\n<p>It's to be determined how this experiment will go, but Mailata says he is not turning back.<\/p>\n<p>\"I knew that I was going to be giving this my all, because walking away from something I knew that well to go into something that was very foreign was a big risk to take,\" he said. \"So I was definitely all-in when I made my decision.\"<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n"},{"images":[{"width":600,"name":"Washington State - Luke Falk [600x600]","peers":[{"width":1296,"name":"Washington State - Luke Falk

Falk<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There will now be a link between Falk and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady\">Tom Brady<\/a> for the rest of the former's career after the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ten/tennessee-titans\">Titans<\/a> selected him with the 199th overall pick Saturday -- the same one\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots\">New England<\/a> used on its future Hall of Famer in 2000.<\/p>\n<p>The similarities between the two quarterbacks don't just stop with the pick number, either.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><inline1><\/p>\n<p>Falk idolizes Brady, modeling his game after the five-time Super Bowl champion and even following the TB12 program, Brady's unique approach to off-field training.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\"It's a pretty crazy coincidence -- [he's] somebody I look up to,\" said Falk, a former walk-on who became the all-time Pac-12 leader in career passing yards, touchdowns and total offense (passing Titans starter <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576980/marcus-mariota\">Marcus Mariota<\/a>) while at Washington State.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Falk sees a lot of parallels between their careers prior to the NFL.<\/p>\n<p>\"We have the same similarities in terms of style of play,\" he said. \"We're not the most mobile guys. We can do stuff in the pocket, creating throws in a small space. [We're] accurate, kind of have the same compact throwing motion. He's the best to do it. Somebody to look up to that I've always tried to model my game after. It's a huge coincidence, pick 199. I'm so grateful that Tennessee took a shot on me.\"<\/p>\n<p>Falk is expected to develop as a backup behind Mariota. Both players share the same agent. Veteran <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13987/blaine-gabbert\">Blaine Gabbert<\/a> was signed to be Mariota's backup, but Falk likely will compete with him and could force the Titans and new coach Mike Vrabel -- Brady's former teammate in New England -- to keep three quarterbacks.<\/p>\n<p>Falk also has Nashville ties. He has two sisters who live there trying to make it as country singers. He joked he has somewhere to stay temporarily when he arrives in Nashville.<\/p>\n<p>Ranked 96th on ESPN analyst Mel Kiper's Big Board, Falk said he was surprised to still be on the board in the sixth round. But he attributes it to the next step of his football career, having to exceed lower expectations.<\/p>\n<p>\"I expected to get off the board a little earlier ... The word that came to mind was 'shocked.' It wasn't exactly how I thought it'd play out,\" Falk said.<\/p>\n<p>\"It's been a pretty grueling process. When I finally got the phone call and saw my name on the TV, nothing but gratitude. It's been an interesting football career -- I had two scholarship offers, both pulled. Went to Washington State, seventh guy on the depth chart, trying to claw your way up. Your locker is in a different spot. You're not able to eat with the team. You're paying for your own books. You're paying for your own way. It's tough. I thought it got me to have a gritty attitude, a 'can do' mindset and knowing it's a marathon. I'll take all those lessons that I had at Washington State and bring them with me to the next level.\"<\/p>\n<p>Before Falk, the\u00a0only QB taken at No. 199 since Brady was picked was <a

href=\"http://insider.espn.com/nfl/draft/player/_/id/101811/kahlil-mckenzie\">Kahlil McKenzie<\/a> had been a member of the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs<\/a>\u00a0for only a few minutes Saturday when he started with the trash talk with his father, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/oak/oakland-raiders\">Oakland Raiders<\/a> general manager Reggie McKenzie.<\/p>\n<p>\"I can't wait to whip up on you twice this year and the next year and the next year and the next year after that,'' Kahlil said he told his father. \"We're a competitive family [by] nature. We compete in everything we do. This just adds one more ripple into that. We're all excited for it. I'm excited to get to Kansas City and just help the Chiefs ... whoop up on the Raiders [and] whoop up on the rest of the NFL.''<\/p>\n<p>The Chiefs drafted McKenzie out of Tennessee in the sixth round. He was a defensive lineman in college, but the Chiefs said they will move him to guard.<\/p>\n<p><inline1><\/p>\n<p>McKenzie said that decision pleased his father, a former linebacker for the Raiders. Reggie's twin brother, Raleigh, had a 16-year NFL career as an offensive lineman with four NFL teams.<\/p>\n<p>Kahlil did some offensive line drills at his pro day at Tennessee at the request of some NFL teams, including the Chiefs.<\/p>\n<p>\"He had a sly little smile on his face,'' Kahlil said of his father. \"I told him, 'It's a conspiracy. This is you. You did this.' He always wanted me to play offensive line. He was happy to see me play offensive line and said that I moved really well doing it. He said I looked like an offensive lineman doing those drills.''<\/p>\n<p>Reggie's eyes welled with tears when talking about what it was like seeing his son drafted.<\/p>\n<p>\"I'm proud of him, and I told him that. I told him, 'We take you, we're going to put you on the offensive line, too,'\" Reggie said.<\/p>\n<p>The elder McKenzie said he received a text from former Raiders standout Charles Woodson once Kahlil's selection by the Chiefs was announced.<\/p>\n<p>\"He told me, 'Your son has to retire. There's no way he's going to put that red helmet on his head.' Part of me felt that way,\" Reggie said. \"But in all seriousness, it's a good opportunity for him, and I was hoping he would land in a spot that would kind of grow him to that position.<\/p>\n<p>\"He can play D-tackle, but I think he probably could be special on the offensive line. And that's where we wanted to play him.\"<\/p>\n<p><em>ESPN's Paul Gutierrez contributed to this report.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n"}],"headline":"Collection"},{"feedDisplayType":"Default","description":"What do NFL GMs, personnel directors and coaches really think of all the players in the 2018 class?

They acted accordingly in the draft, using their first four choices to select offensive players. It began with the trade up from the 15th pick into the 10th slot to select <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3886377/josh-rosen\">Josh Rosen<\/a>, the talented and perpetually outspoken quarterback from UCLA.<\/p>\n<p>\"I was hoping they would stay at 15 and get <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson<\/a>, but I don't have a problem with what they did,\" an exec said. \"Everybody recognizes the talent with Rosen, but he is not the top guy in the draft because nobody likes him.\"<\/p>\n<p>The Cardinals were in a difficult spot. They needed a quarterback, but they couldn't realistically trade up high enough to have their choice. They would land whichever quarterback lasted long enough to reach within striking distance. Rosen was prickly out of the gates, saying he would not \"come in and be an a--h--- and think that my s--- don't stink,\" despite being \"pissed\" that teams drafting ahead of Arizona made \"big mistakes\" in choosing other QBs.<\/p>\n<p>Exec after exec said the same things about Rosen. One called the former UCLA quarterback a combination of Jeff George and Jay Cutler who would struggle to lead a team. Another worried that Rosen was not durable, comparing him to current Cardinals starter <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13197/sam-bradford\">Sam Bradford<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\"I think they have it set up right in Arizona because [offensive coordinator] Mike McCoy can speak the kid's language and talk fast enough to try to stay ahead of the kid so he does not get bored,\" an insider said.<\/p>\n<p>An exec noted that quarterbacks coach Byron Leftwich, already considered future head-coaching material by former Cardinals coach Bruce Arians, would become a shooting star if he could help mold Rosen into a success.<\/p>\n<p>\"Byron will be good for the kid if Rosen allows it,\" an insider said.<\/p>\n<p>This insider then let out a chuckle.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"atl\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\"Byron in about a week will probably want to take a poke at him,\" this insider continued. \"He's from f---ing D.C., and he ain't having a cake eater walk in and act like an a--h---.\"<\/p>\n\n\n<p><offer><\/offer><\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/atl.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-falcons\">Atlanta Falcons<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Seven years ago, the Falcons traded up from 27th to the sixth spot to select the second receiver in the 2011 draft class (<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13982/julio-jones\">Julio Jones<\/a>). They got the second receiver in the 2018 class (<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3925357/calvin-ridley\">Calvin Ridley<\/a>) without leaving their spot at No. 26 in the order. That illustrates just how lightly teams regarded the 2018 receiving crop at the top, although there were no assurances that Ridley would remain available long enough for Atlanta to snag him.<\/p>\n<p>\"I love the pick,\" an exec said. \"We wanted Calvin Ridley. It's just a great pick for them at that time -- not a good pick, a great pick.\"<\/p>\n<p>The Falcons have a defense-minded head coach empowered by recent success. It would have come as no shock had they used their first-round choice to address needs on defense -- especially up front. But the offense also needs help. Atlanta averaged 17.7 points per game in its final seven games last season, including the playoffs. The Falcons failed to reach even 14 points in three of those games.<\/p>\n<p>\"Ridley will be great for their offense, but I think there's a lot of risk on the corner they took in the second round,\" an insider said. \"<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915437/isaiah-oliver\">Isaiah Oliver<\/a> is always nicked up.\"<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/bal.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens\">Baltimore Ravens<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>GM Ozzie Newsome called the first round \"masterful\" for the Ravens after the team maneuvered multiple times before coming away with tight end <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3924365/hayden-hurst\">Hayden Hurst<\/a> and quarterback Lamar Jackson. Others around the league did not reject Newsome's characterization.<\/p>\n<p><alsosee><\/p>\n<p>\"Lamar Jackson at No. 32 was my favorite pick of the first round,\" an exec said. \"You get a fifth-year option for a quarterback who has a chance to come in and unseat <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11252/joe-flacco\">Joe Flacco<\/a> in a hurry and is a dynamic playmaker. It's a genius first round for me because they kept trading back and still got the guys they wanted. We compared the tight end [Hurst] to Todd Heap, so the fit really could not be any better in Baltimore.\"<\/p>\n<p>Another exec compared Jackson favorably to Michael Vick, whose former quarterbacks coach in Philly (James Urban) holds the same job in Baltimore.<\/p>\n<p>\"Can you teach a guy to see it quicker and become accurate?\" an exec asked. \"That will be the question with Jackson. The talent is there. He is probably a better scrambler than Vick. He probably has better passing technique than Vick had, and if you really want to look at it, Michael Vick was the first pick in the draft who had a good career.\"<\/p>\n<p>Not everyone loves Jackson as a prospect, or else other teams would have been scrambling to select him earlier in the round.<\/p>\n<p>\"Thirteen test score [on the Wonderlic], and his mom is his agent,\" one skeptic said.<\/p>\n<p>Another insider bristled over the gap between Jackson's college production and where he was selected, particularly with so many questions surrounding the other quarterbacks.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"buf\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\"We will take Rosen, whose teammates dislike him and who makes a fool of himself on TV,\" this insider said, \"but there were only a few teams that would have taken Jackson, even though he could be the best quarterback in this draft.\"<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/buf.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills\">Buffalo Bills<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Football decision-makers often say no one will remember what a team gave up to get a quarterback if that quarterback becomes an elite player. In the meantime, the prices paid are very much fresh in our minds right now. Buffalo parted with tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14971/cordy-glenn\">Cordy Glenn<\/a> and two second-round choices (plus minor considerations) in jumping from the 21st to the 12th to the seventh overall pick.<\/p>\n<p>That is where Buffalo bet its future on Wyoming quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\"It's a cold-weather quarterback who is big and strong, not frail and little, in a cold-weather city where it's windy,\" an exec said. \"You are going to have to throw it through the wind and he can do those things. Good job for that. He is aw-shucks, likes football, makes his team visits with sweats and tennis shoes -- perfect for Buffalo. They don't need <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052587/baker-mayfield\">Baker Mayfield<\/a> in f---ing designer clothes, OK? They need Jim Kelly.\"<\/p>\n<p>For the Bills, this draft was about finding a quarterback and loading up on defense with linebacker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3929950/tremaine-edmunds\">Tremaine Edmunds<\/a>, defensive tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117255/harrison-phillips\">Harrison Phillips<\/a>, cornerback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121003/taron-johnson\">Taron Johnson<\/a> and cornerback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3057524/siran-neal\">Siran Neal<\/a> in the first five rounds.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"car\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\"The linebacker [Edmunds] is a play-making, run-around, off-the-ball 'backer,\" an exec said, \"and guess what they play in Buffalo?

That is D.J. Moore.

Others questioned the wisdom of selecting a 3-4 inside linebacker with a top-10 pick, while acknowledging that this draft wasn't packed with game-changing playmakers as alternatives.<\/p>\n<p>\"Our room was buzzing over Roquan Smith,\" an exec said. \"He was the consensus best inside linebacker in the draft. Who else could the Bears have taken? They weren't going to take the tackle [<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052885/mike-mcglinchey\">Mike McGlinchey<\/a>] unless their line coach was standing on the table saying McGlinchey would start at left tackle this year. They weren't going to take a receiver.

Did Cincy settle?<\/p>\n<p>\"There are tougher poker players to read at the table than the Bengals,\" an insider said. \"The Lions knew that if Ragnow got to them, Cincy wasn't going to trade ahead of them to take him.

They traded the 12th overall pick to Buffalo for left tackle Cordy Glenn and the 21st pick. Would you rather have the 12th pick or Glenn plus Price? The top tackle (McGlinchey) was gone at No. 9, while the next tackle, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3134312/kolton-miller\">Kolton Miller<\/a>, lasted until Oakland at No. 15.<\/p>\n<p>\"The veteran market is for needs, and the draft is for finding the best players,\" an exec said. \"Cincinnati addressed the need with Glenn, but then they drafted for need, too.\"<\/p>\n<p>One evaluator who preferred Price to Ragnow still had concerns about Price's health, while another said he had Price as a \"run-of-the-mill\" center, below Daniels, whom the Bears selected 18 spots later at No. 39.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"cle\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><photo1><\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/cle.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns\">Cleveland Browns<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>What if someone told you two months ago that the Browns would select Baker Mayfield first overall?<\/p>\n<p>\"No F'ing way,\" said an exec. \"I came to grips with it the night before, but I didn't fully come to grips with it until the card was turned in, and I was like, 'My God, what is going on here?'\"<\/p>\n<p>This exec said much of the quarterback evaluation process comes down to the feel a team has after meeting with a player.<\/p>\n<p><inline6><\/p>\n<p>\"John [Dorsey] wants a leader of men,\" this exec said. \"He must have thought Baker was a leader of men.

Their decision to select a consensus top-three player in this draft class provided fodder for debate, not for the player but rather for the position. Gettleman bristled at skeptics. Some fired back sharply (on Twitter, of course).<\/p>\n<p>\"It's like the left vs. the right in politics where we become these ideologues and zealots.

Would you rather have the best pure pass-rusher along with a pretty good back, or would you rather have the best back along with a decent whatever else? I'd take the best pass-rusher with a pretty good back.\"<\/p>\n<p>There were no assurances, however, that the Giants could still get a back they liked in the second round. Barkley was a sure top-10 pick, and two of the most successful teams, Seattle and New England, selected running backs later in the first round. If the Giants still wanted a back at No. 34, they could have been vulnerable to Cleveland or others jumping them (the Browns took <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128720/nick-chubb\">Nick Chubb<\/a> 35th, which spurred Tampa Bay to take <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3912550/ronald-jones-ii\">Ronald Jones II<\/a> at 38).<\/p>\n<p>\"Gettleman has experience in Carolina in how to help the quarterback,\" an exec said. \"He has a run-first, protect-Eli, protect-<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13994/cam-newton\">Cam [Newton]<\/a> strategy that the Giants want to hear.

This draft appeared more focused.\"<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"tb\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><photo6><\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/tb.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-buccaneers\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Buccaneers were offseason media darlings a year ago after loading up in free agency. They have spent the most in recent months, including this draft, refocusing on the type of players they bring into their organization. They went for substance over style in trading back five spots from No. 7 to select defensive tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3134362/vita-vea\">Vita Vea<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\"Vea has a chance because he is so frickin' massive, but in my opinion, he is not a guy that is going to come in and rush the passer,\" one exec said. \"I think they are trying to clean up, personality-wise. [Second-round corner] <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116679/mj-stewart\">M.J. Stewart<\/a> is extremely high-character but probably nickel only, not an outside guy. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916923/carlton-davis\">Carlton Davis<\/a> [another second-round corner] was a little stiff, so they got two corners without great movement skills, but they got good people in this draft.\"<\/p>\n<p>Whether Vea becomes a three-down player could determine whether the Buccaneers feel good about exercising his fifth-year option and signing him to a second contract. Those are the long-term considerations that come into play in relation to positional value.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"ten\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\"There are times you watch Vea, and you see the sheer dominance,\" an evaluator said, \"but then you also know <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2578384/danny-shelton\">Danny Shelton<\/a> was picked seventh overall, and look where he is now. Cleveland was not going to pay him or give him the fifth-year option, so he is gone. Could that happen to Tampa? It could if he is a two-down player.\"<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/ten.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ten/tennessee-titans\">Tennessee Titans<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Evaluators typically think getting two starters from a draft is average and three is succeeding. Tennessee drafted only four players, trading up for two of them.<\/p>\n<p>\"It looked like the new head coach saying he needed this guy and that guy,\" an exec said. \"Do they get two starters with only four picks when two are after the fourth round? They said they are happy with the roster and have great depth, but do they? The guys they moved up for might be great players, but you don't really know at this point. Unless you are up so high and the guy is so special, that is tough.\"<\/p>\n<p>Some insiders liked the players Tennessee picked, including first-round linebacker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3126349/rashaan-evans\">Rashaan Evans<\/a>. The criticisms were more about how the Titans went about their business, trading up twice and paying prices that were not insignificant.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"wsh\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\"Evans is a good inside linebacker who fits the New England mold of being versatile and having some rush ability,\" an exec said. \"He is not very instinctive as an inside linebacker yet, which is why he was third or fourth on my list at the position. If [Harold] Landry had come out last year, he might have been a top-10 pick, but he stayed and struggled and coasted. There is definitely boom-or-bust potential with him.\"<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/wsh.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/wsh/washington-redskins\">Washington Redskins<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The Redskins took the same risk the Bucs took by using a top-15 pick for a defensive lineman who could be at his best against the run. Beyond that potential limitation, there were no serious concerns over Alabama defensive tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3925354/da'ron-payne\">Da'Ron Payne<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\"It is the NFC East and you will play <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051392/ezekiel-elliott\">Ezekiel Elliott<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3929630/saquon-barkley\">Saquon Barkley<\/a> and all that, but you need speed and athletes on the field,\" an exec said. \"I would have taken <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3929950/tremaine-edmunds\">Tremaine Edmunds<\/a> because he is 19 years old [20 as of Wednesday], and he is a three-down player no matter what. He can drop, he can pass rush, he can play the run. He could play inside linebacker, outside linebacker, defensive end -- you name it. And when he is 21-22 years old, he could be 245 pounds.\"<\/p>\n<p>This was the Redskins' second draft without a general manager in title after two drafts with Scot McCloughan in the role.<\/p>\n<p>\"I thought they had a pretty good draft,\" an evaluator said. \"Jay [Gruden} is a good evaluator as far as head coaches go and that gives them a chance.\"<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n"},{"feedDisplayType":"Default","description":"Did the Patriots find their new slot receiver in Round 6?

Hello, Berrios? Yes, he's two inches shorter than Amendola, but the 5-foot-9 Berrios is a true slot receiver, and the Patriots have proved they can find effective roles for those guys, beginning with Wes Welker in 2007. Berrios really only got playing time in one season at Miami, catching 55 passes for 679 yards and nine touchdowns last season. He also returned punts and had a touchdown return in 2016.

But both Hines and Wilkins should get snaps. Hines, who's only 5-foot-8, 198 pounds, ran a 4.38 40 at the combine and is one the entire class' fastest prospects. My comp for him has been Darren Sproles, as Hines is a good receiver and good in space. He had 88 career catches at NC State.\u00a0Wilkins, who missed the entire 2016 season because of an academic suspension, returned last season and averaged 6.5 yards per carry for the Rebels. He's a bigger back (6-foot-1, 216) with some quickness.

He's only 5-foot-11, 225, but he can be a running back on third down. He could play some snaps at fullback. Put him in the slot a few times a game. He could line up\u00a0as a tight end.

But the athleticism is there -- his 39.5-inch vertical was the highest of any edge rusher at the combine, while his broad jump (10-foot-4) ranked second and his 4.53 40 time third. If he's in a situational role, he could be a good player. And we know the Eagles and defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz like to rotate their front seven.

Goedert can fill that in Year 1. He was my top-ranked tight end in this class.

(And, as I noted in my grades, the Eagles led the league with 110 receptions by tight ends.) That will stretch opposing defenses because Goedert is such a good pass-catcher, and he's an underrated route runner. Goedert isn't a great blocker, but he should improve there, and free-agent signing <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16786/richard-rodgers\" target=\"_new\">Richard Rodgers<\/a> could get some of those snaps lined up next to offensive tackles.

I like the fit here because the Bucs' offense has used running backs in the receiving game -- just look at Sims' 2015 season, which was Dirk Koetter's first in charge of the Tampa Bay offense, when Sims had 51 catches and four touchdowns. If <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2969939/jameis-winston\" target=\"_new\">Jameis Winston<\/a> can hit those easy throws, the offense will be better.

But those two combined for 23 sacks last season, and the rest of the team had only 20. So Nwosu should spell each as a situational pass-rusher, and all three could play together, particularly if Bosa kicks inside on some third downs. Nwosu is going to struggle against the run early -- he's undersized at 6-foot-2, 251 pounds -- but he can get after quarterbacks.

Big, every-down backs drafted in the top 10 are going to get the ball as rookies. Expect new Giants coach Pat Shurmur to give the ball to Barkley, who is the early favorite to be the offensive rookie of the year. And remember: Barkley is a weapon in the passing game -- he had 1,000 receiving yards at Penn State.

Barkley is an immediate upgrade.

Last season, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3039707/mitchell-trubisky\">Mitchell Trubisky<\/a> was sacked on 8.1 percent of his dropbacks (worst in the NFL), so more protection was needed. Chicago gave up a lot (next year's second-rounder) to move up for WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3050487/anthony-miller\">Anthony Miller<\/a>, but I love his potential. And seventh-rounder <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035019/javon-wims\">Javon Wims<\/a> could make the team as the No. 4 wideout. At the end of the day, the Bears got at least three quality starters and some potential contributors. A good haul.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/den.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/den/denver-broncos\">Denver Broncos<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>When Denver won Super Bowl 50, it was on the back of a terrific defense led by an elite pass rush. The Broncos picked up the most complete\u00a0defensive player in the draft --\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116733/bradley-chubb\">Bradley Chubb<\/a>, my second-ranked player overall -- at No. 5 to play opposite <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13976/von-miller\">Von Miller<\/a>. And WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128429/courtland-sutton\">Courtland Sutton<\/a> was a good value in the second round where they got him. He needs to be more physical and improve his route running, but he has a lot of potential. Third-round CB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122797/isaac-yiadom\">Isaac Yiadom<\/a> fits what Denver wants in terms of a long corner, and RB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122672/royce-freeman\">Royce Freeman<\/a> was a solid value in the third at a need area, with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/16040/cj-anderson\">C.J. Anderson<\/a> cut. I like the picks of WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3057987/daesean-hamilton\">DaeSean Hamilton<\/a> and TE <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045264/troy-fumagalli\">Troy Fumagalli<\/a> as well. The Broncos got better on defense and surrounded a new QB (<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15168/case-keenum\">Case Keenum<\/a>) with playmakers.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/hou.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/hou/houston-texans\">Houston Texans<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>I don't know that many more teams did more with less than Houston. The Texans didn't pick until No. 68 -- because of the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson\">Deshaun Watson<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14879/brock-osweiler\">Brock Osweiler<\/a> deals -- but I loved the value they got. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3931399/justin-reid\">Justin Reid<\/a> could be a starting safety (especially after Houston lost <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14018/marcus-gilchrist\">Marcus Gilchrist<\/a>) and I had a late first- or early second-round grade on him. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3894924/martinas-rankin\">Martinas Rankin<\/a> is raw but will compete for a spot on the offensive line and I'd expect him to win a starting guard spot. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128452/jordan-akins\">Jordan Akins<\/a> isn't going to be a starter, but he can be a No. 2 pass-catching tight end. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915823/keke-coutee\">Keke Coutee<\/a> seemed to be in the end zone every time I turned on the tape and held a coveted spot on my <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/draft2018/insider/story/_/id/23042779/2018-nfl-draft-todd-mcshay-all-satellite-team-best-playmakers-class\">All-Satellite team<\/a>. And <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035379/jordan-thomas\">Jordan Thomas<\/a> has football character questions, but good traits. A great draft, especially considering their first-round pick was basically Watson.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/ind.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts\">Indianapolis Colts<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>This draft was all about quantity (11 picks, with six on the offensive side and five on defense) for Indianapolis, which realized it had a lot of holes to fill. And it was about protecting <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14874/andrew-luck\">Andrew Luck<\/a> and building the defense, as two of the top three picks were guards. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3129308/quenton-nelson\">Quenton Nelson<\/a> is a rock-solid prospect and will start immediately, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121595/braden-smith\">Braden Smith<\/a> should contribute as well. Running back <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916430/nyheim-hines\">Nyheim Hines<\/a> in the fourth round should be an extension of the passing game, as he's good in space. This is the draft Indianapolis needed for its continued rebuild.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/lac.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers\">Los Angeles Chargers<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>I thought <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3691739/derwin-james\">Derwin James<\/a> could go as high as No. 7 to Tampa Bay, so getting my seventh-ranked player at 17 is tremendous value. Gus Bradley's defense needs a long, playmaking safety -- a guy who can come up and fill one side in run support and essentially is another linebacker. As one of the most versatile prospects I've ever evaluated, James fits that bill. Second-round OLB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3120358/uchenna-nwosu\">Uchenna Nwosu<\/a> adds pass-rushing help and third-round DT <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116746/justin-jones\">Justin Jones<\/a> is another big body to help out on the D-line. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4039254/kyzir-white\">Kyzir White<\/a> fits what they want in terms of a physical hitter at safety and can be used as a sub-package linebacker. All seven draftees could make the roster and contribute.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/min.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/min/minnesota-vikings\">Minnesota Vikings<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This team didn't have a lot of holes to fill but did a nice job adding some in key need areas. To me, Minnesota's biggest need was offensive line (tackle or guard) -- and it addressed that with\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3123954/brian-o'neill\">Brian O'Neill<\/a>\u00a0at No. 62 (and doubled down with\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3049575/colby-gossett\">Colby Gossett<\/a> in the sixth). He needs some technique refinement but is one of the most athletic tackles in the draft. I thought <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3895841/mike-hughes\">Mike Hughes<\/a> (No. 30 overall) was the second-best cover corner in the draft, so getting him at 30 was a good value. He's insurance if Minnesota doesn't want to pay <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576283/trae-waynes\">Trae Waynes<\/a> after this year. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121414/jalyn-holmes\">Jalyn Holmes<\/a> (No. 102) has a lot of potential to contribute to the D-line rotation and I loved the move to trade up for kicker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051909/daniel-carlson\">Daniel Carlson<\/a> in the fifth round. He's a clutch kicker with a big leg, something Minnesota has lacked since <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/15058/blair-walsh\">Blair Walsh<\/a>'s rookie year.<\/p>\n<p>Undrafted signings Holton Hill and Hercules Mata'afa could make the roster as well. Minnesota probably got three starters, a couple of contributors and at least a couple of guys with upside in this draft. Nice work by general manager Rick Spielman.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/nyg.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyg/new-york-giants\">New York Giants<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>New GM Dave Gettleman had a clear vision to get back to a power running game in this draft -- and he did just that. You can question the potential value of drafting <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3929630/saquon-barkley\">Saquon Barkley<\/a> at No. 2, but he was top overall prospect and the second-highest-rated RB since <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/10452/adrian-peterson\">Adrian Peterson<\/a>. And I liked the second-round pick of guard\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3042516/will-hernandez\">Will Hernandez<\/a> -- a mauling run-blocker at 6-foot-2, 327 pounds -- to pave the way for Barkley. The Giants had to address their offensive line this offseason, and between the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13964/nate-solder\">Nate Solder<\/a> signing and drafting Hernandez, they've done that. Third-rounder <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128715/lorenzo-carter\">Lorenzo Carter<\/a> is a good fit for James Bettcher's 3-4 defense at outside linebacker and DT <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116748/bj-hill\">B.J. Hill<\/a> (third) and LB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917872/rj-mcintosh\">R.J. McIntosh<\/a> (fifth) were good values.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, the Giants got my guy, QB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3049872/kyle-lauletta\">Kyle Lauletta<\/a> from Richmond, in the fourth as a potential replacement down the road for <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5526/eli-manning\">Eli Manning<\/a>. The Giants hit their top four needs with their top five picks. A solid draft.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/nyj.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>This is all about QB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3912547/sam-darnold\">Sam Darnold<\/a>. When the Jets traded up from No. 6 to No. 3, they were hoping Darnold would be there -- but probably were expecting <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052587/baker-mayfield\">Baker Mayfield<\/a> or <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen<\/a>, at best. Instead, Darnold fell into their lap, and Jets fans have hope for the future. He's the youngest quarterback in the first round and was my favorite QB throughout the process. Darnold has the even-keeled demeanor to succeed in New York, a good mentor in <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3609/josh-mccown\">Josh McCown<\/a> and a great offensive coordinator in Jeremy Bates. Yes, the Jets still have needs on offense, but this franchise is headed in the right direction if it has finally found its franchise QB.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/phi.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Philadelphia Eagles<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>The Eagles didn't have a lot of holes to fill, but I loved how they maneuvered in the draft. First, they moved back from 32 to 52 and picked up Baltimore's 2019 second-round pick in the process. Then, they moved up from 52 to 49 to jump ahead of the Cowboys -- a team in desperate need of a tight end -- to take <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121023/dallas-goedert\">Dallas Goedert<\/a>. Goedert should be an immediate contributor and help fill the void created at backup tight end when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16974/trey-burton\">Trey Burton<\/a> left. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3693166/josh-sweat\">Josh Sweat<\/a> was a good value in the fourth round as well. He's a first-round talent who had a top-10 workout but fell because of a knee issue. The Eagles should be able to prolong his career by using him in a rotation.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/ne.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots\">New England Patriots<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>As usual, New England did a great job of maneuvering in the draft and turning picks into more picks, including landing a 2019 third-rounder from Detroit and 2019 second-rounder from Chicago. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128721/sony-michel\">Sony Michel<\/a> is the type of versatile running back New England covets and should be kept fresh in a rotational role. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128713/isaiah-wynn\">Isaiah Wynn<\/a> should help along the offensive line -- even if he doesn't take Solder's spot at left tackle. And <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3123075/braxton-berrios\">Braxton Berrios<\/a> should fit well as another potential slot receiver.

The Vikings are happy with their second-round pick in offensive tackle Brian O'Neill, but he's going to need time to develop and might not be ready to take over duties at right tackle in time for Week 1. The state of the offensive line will be among the biggest storylines to watch ahead of training camp.

They're happy with the depth on the offensive line despite losing left guard <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/17388/andrew-norwell\">Andrew Norwell<\/a>, but look for them to bring in a few big men as undrafted free agents. That's how Norwell got his start.

Bills were targeting a quarterback tends to make you forget this was a playoff team, so the first round was an interesting mix, as they added both high-upside potential at the game's most important position, and also immediate help at a spot where rookies can often be found contributing. They gave up some notable draft value in second-round picks to maneuver, but I'm not sure any team added this kind of high-upside talent. Key word: upside.<\/p>\n<p>We know <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\" target=\"_new\">Josh Allen<\/a> (pick 7) needs development as a player with great traits but lacking polish out of Wyoming, but development is a given for any QB. The addition of <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3929950/tremaine-edmunds\" target=\"_new\">Tremaine Edmunds<\/a> (16) means that the Bills managed to get two of my top 11 players in this draft class, and Edmunds is likely to help right away. The useful immediate help and long-range upside wasn't limited to Round 1, either. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117255/harrison-phillips\" target=\"_new\">Harrison Phillips<\/a> (96) is an interior disruptor who can jump into the mix in Week 1. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/9720/kyle-williams\" target=\"_new\">Kyle Williams<\/a> won't play forever (probably?) so this was a good fit. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121003/taron-johnson\" target=\"_new\">Taron Johnson<\/a> (121) can get on the field early. He won't be a No. 1 corner, but in the fifth round, he's a decent get. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3728262/ray-ray-mccloud\" target=\"_new\">Ray-Ray McCloud<\/a> (187) is a wildcard, but he can jump into the return game and could factor into the wide receiver depth chart.<\/p>\n<p>Yeah, it'll come down to Allen, but if he reaches his upside, you change the direction of the franchise. He could be a perfect fit in Buffalo. As it always goes with big bets on quarterbacks, time will tell the story.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"CAR\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><inline1-wide><\/p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/car.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/car/carolina-panthers\" target=\"_new\">Carolina Panthers<\/a>: A-<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Top needs:<\/strong> Wide receiver, cornerback, defensive end<\/p>\n<p>Like their NFC South rivals in Atlanta, the Panthers went with a wide receiver in Round 1, taking Maryland's\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915416/dj-moore\" target=\"_new\">D.J. Moore<\/a> at No. 24. I'm a big fan of Moore, who is more than a workout warrior, though he put up freakish numbers at the combine with a 4.42 40 time and 39.5-inch vertical. He was productive for the Terps, and he's great after the catch. He runs through arm tackles, and he's built like a tailback. The Panthers needed a guy like that for <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13994/cam-newton\" target=\"_new\">Cam Newton<\/a>, and it wasn't going to be veteran <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14032/torrey-smith\" target=\"_new\">Torrey Smith<\/a> (another Terp), who was brought in last month. Moore could be Newton's favorite target in a hurry.<\/p>\n<p>After parting ways with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3042436/daryl-worley\" target=\"_new\">Daryl Worley<\/a>, the Panthers needed cornerbacks to compete for the spot opposite <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2572841/james-bradberry\" target=\"_new\">James Bradberry<\/a>. They added two on Day 2 with\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3843769/donte-jackson\" target=\"_new\">Donte Jackson<\/a> (pick 55), one of the fastest players in this class (4.32 40), and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115333/rashaan-gaulden\" target=\"_new\">Rashaan Gaulden<\/a> (85), whom I had rated as more of a sixth-round talent. (Remember that veteran safety <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13340/kurt-coleman\" target=\"_new\">Kurt Coleman<\/a> is no longer with the team.) Jackson is only 5-10 and 178 pounds, but he's an elite athlete. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4045305/ian-thomas\" target=\"_new\">Ian Thomas<\/a> could develop into the heir apparent to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/10475/greg-olsen\" target=\"_new\">Greg Olsen<\/a>, and to get my fourth-ranked tight end at 104 is great value. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115456/marquis-haynes\" target=\"_new\">Marquis Haynes<\/a> (136) is another good player on Day 3.<\/p>\n<p>If there's an issue with this class, it's not getting a pass-rusher. Are they really going to rely on 38-year-old Julius Peppers to play almost 500 snaps again? <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14320/mario-addison\" target=\"_new\">Mario Addison<\/a> is also going to be 31 by Week 1, and you face <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11237/matt-ryan\" target=\"_new\">Matt Ryan<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2580/drew-brees\" target=\"_new\">Drew Brees<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2969939/jameis-winston\" target=\"_new\">Jameis Winston<\/a> six times a year in that division. I liked the depth of this class, though, and won't ding it too much.

That was a major weakness last season -- the Green Bay secondary couldn't stop wide receivers. It gave up an NFL-high 21 touchdown passes to receivers. So new GM Brian Gutekunst went out and got two corners with his first two picks to address that problem, and I like both players. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3895429/jaire-alexander\" target=\"_new\">Jaire Alexander<\/a> (pick 18) is an elite athlete and playmaker. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3144984/josh-jackson\" target=\"_new\">Josh Jackson<\/a> (45) led the FBS with eight interceptions in 2017. He's a ball hawk, and I was really surprised that the Packers were able to get him when they did. Possible steal. They're going to create turnovers. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052170/kevin-king\" target=\"_new\">Kevin King<\/a> had an injury-plagued rookie season and started only five games, but he's a good player, too. That's a talented cornerback group. I also liked third-round pick <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051746/oren-burks\" target=\"_new\">Oren Burks<\/a>, who probably will play inside linebacker. He was versatile and consistent at Vanderbilt.<\/p>\n<p>The best move the Packers made this weekend, though, was adding an extra 2019 first-round pick. New Orleans traded up from No. 27 to No. 14 to take <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3124058/marcus-davenport\" target=\"_new\">Marcus Davenport<\/a>, and Green Bay moved out of Round 1 (and then later moved back in by dealing third- and sixth-round picks to Seattle). That's a huge chip to have next year, when the pass-rushing prospects should be better than they were in this class.<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051857/j'mon-moore\" target=\"_new\">J'Mon Moore<\/a> (133) offers some receiving depth, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052065/cole-madison\" target=\"_new\">Cole Madison<\/a> (138) reminds me a lot of what <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15963/david-bakhtiari\" target=\"_new\">David Bakhtiari<\/a> was coming out of college. That worked out just fine. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3126368/jk-scott\" target=\"_new\">JK Scott<\/a> (172) was my third-ranked punter. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3932442/equanimeous-st-brown\" target=\"_new\">Equanimeous St. Brown<\/a> (207) is worth a late Day 3 pick as a talented but inconsistent wide receiver. The reason this class gets an \"A\" is the 2019 first-rounder it added from New Orleans. Now, that could end up being a very late Day 1 pick. I don't care. I really like what Gutekunst did in his first draft.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"PHI\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><inline3-wide><\/p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/phi.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\" target=\"_new\">Philadelphia Eagles<\/a>: A-<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Top needs:<\/strong> Offensive tackle, linebacker, wide receiver<\/p>\n<p>It's good to be the Eagles. Coming off a Super Bowl title, they have no major needs and get to develop starters -- not try to draft plug-and-play guys. They're looking for impact depth. That's why we saw GM Howie Roseman trade out of the last pick in the first round to move down 20 spots and add an extra 2019 second-round pick (plus pick 125 in this draft). That 2019 pick is an extremely valuable one to stash away.<\/p>\n<p>Now, you have to laugh at the Eagles trading up three spots to take tight end <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121023/dallas-goedert\" target=\"_new\">Dallas Goedert<\/a> ahead of Dallas (49) with the draft in the Dallas area. And my best comp for Goedert all along was <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15835/zach-ertz\" target=\"_new\">Zach Ertz<\/a>, so now the Eagles have both players. Goedert is the best pass-catching and most athletic tight end in this class. Remember: <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16974/trey-burton\" target=\"_new\">Trey Burton<\/a> and Brent Celek are both gone from 2018, so Goedert is going to play. Philadelphia led the league with 110 receptions by tight ends last season. If Goedert had gone late in Round 1 -- maybe to Philly! -- it wouldn't have surprised me.<\/p>\n<p>The Eagles didn't have a third-round pick due to the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16763/jordan-matthews\" target=\"_new\">Jordan Matthews<\/a>-<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2969920/ronald-darby\" target=\"_new\">Ronald Darby<\/a> swap with Buffalo last year, so Philly had only one pick on the first two days. Fourth-rounders\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3123938/avonte-maddox\" target=\"_new\">Avonte Maddox<\/a> (125) and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3693166/josh-sweat\" target=\"_new\">Josh Sweat<\/a> (130) are talented and athletic. Maddox was a four-year starter who ran a 4.39 at the combine. Sweat had 29 tackles for loss in college and had a 39.5-inch vertical jump at the combine. I moved up <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3055886/matt-pryor\" target=\"_new\">Matt Pryor<\/a> (206) over the past few weeks after people in the league told me he was going to move to guard. And how about the Australian former rugby league player <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4334215/jordan-mailata\" target=\"_new\">Jordan Mailata<\/a> going late in the seventh round? Philly is going to try to make him an offensive tackle.<\/p>\n<p>The reason this class isn't a straight \"A\"? Not a single running back (though they did announce the re-signing of Darren Sproles when the day ended). If that's the only bad thing I can say, the Eagles must have had a good day.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"BAL\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><inline4-wide><\/p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/bal.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens\" target=\"_new\">Baltimore Ravens<\/a>: B+<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Top needs:<\/strong> Wide receiver, guard, tight end<\/p>\n<p>There's no question the Ravens have disappointed lately. They haven't made the playoffs the past three seasons. The offense and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11252/joe-flacco\" target=\"_new\">Joe Flacco<\/a> have taken a step back. So GM Ozzie Newsome, in his last draft in charge, is shaking things up, putting the 33-year-old Flacco on notice. Baltimore traded up into the last pick of the first round -- at a big price, surrendering next year's second-round pick, plus picks Nos. 52 and 125 -- to get <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\" target=\"_new\">Lamar Jackson<\/a>. The 2016 Heisman Trophy winner is the rawest of the top quarterbacks in this class, but he's an electric talent. And with Flacco there and under contract for the short term, Jackson doesn't need to play right away. He can learn the game and keep developing until he's ready. It's a good spot for Jackson.<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere, the Ravens became the only team since the 2012 Colts to take two tight ends in the first three rounds, grabbing <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3924365/hayden-hurst\" target=\"_new\">Hayden Hurst<\/a> (pick 25 after trades down from 16 and 22) and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116365/mark-andrews\" target=\"_new\">Mark Andrews<\/a> (86). Ben Watson accounted for 64 percent of the Ravens' tight end yardage last season, but he's gone. Hurst is a complete player who can line up next to the tackle or in the slot, while Andrews is essentially a 6-5 slot receiver. He had a great college career, and he's going to be a tough cover for linebackers and safeties. We know Flacco loves throwing to tight ends, but sometimes he can rely on them too much. I liked the value getting tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116370/orlando-brown\" target=\"_new\">Orlando Brown<\/a> at 83, and it's cool to see him drafted by the team that his father \"Zeus\" played for. Brown's tape shows a first-round player, but he fell because of a disastrous combine. He could start at right tackle in 2018.<\/p>\n<p>And of course, Ozzie took two more Alabama players in his final draft. Cornerback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3054841/anthony-averett\" target=\"_new\">Anthony Averett<\/a> (118) has a thin frame, but he ran a 4.36 at the combine. Center <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3054842/bradley-bozeman\" target=\"_new\">Bradley Bozeman<\/a> (215) anchored the Crimson Tide offensive line for 31 starts. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3134302/jordan-lasley\" target=\"_new\">Jordan Lasley<\/a> (162) has some off-field issues, but he was <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3886377/josh-rosen\" target=\"_new\">Josh Rosen<\/a>'s favorite target and took over games at times. He's worth the risk there. Safety <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3929846/deshon-elliott\" target=\"_new\">DeShon Elliott<\/a> (190) had six interceptions (two pick-sixes) last season.<\/p>\n<p>The big takeaway here is putting a clock on Flacco's time in Baltimore. Jackson isn't ready to contribute right now, but he could be in 2019.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"CHI\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><inline5-wide><\/p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/chi.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears\" target=\"_new\">Chicago Bears<\/a>: B+<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Top needs:<\/strong> Guard, linebacker, wide receiver<\/p>\n<p>Let's face it: <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3039707/mitchell-trubisky\" target=\"_new\">Mitchell Trubisky<\/a> didn't have a great rookie year. There's a reason John Fox is out and Matt Nagy is in. Nagy, who coached under Andy Reid in Kansas City, is an innovative offensive mind, and his first job is to get the best out of Trubisky. That means adapting the offense to his strengths. For GM Ryan Pace, the best way to help Trubisky is to get him some weapons, and that's clearly what was addressed this offseason with free-agent deals for pass-catchers <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16799/allen-robinson\" target=\"_new\">Allen Robinson<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16974/trey-burton\" target=\"_new\">Trey Burton<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/17437/taylor-gabriel\" target=\"_new\">Taylor Gabriel<\/a>. Pace even brought in kicker\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/17082/cody-parkey\" target=\"_new\">Cody Parkey<\/a> to get some points on the board. I believe in Trubisky's talent -- if he's put in the right situation. And now the situation is much better for him to have a productive 2018.<\/p>\n<p>To continue the theme of helping Trubisky, the Bears added <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3894849/james-daniels\" target=\"_new\">James Daniels<\/a> (pick 39), my second-ranked center who could play guard next to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577346/cody-whitehair\" target=\"_new\">Cody Whitehair<\/a>, and moved up to grab the draft's most underrated receiver in <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3050487/anthony-miller\" target=\"_new\">Anthony Miller<\/a> (51). It was a lot to give up -- a 2019 second-round pick and a fourth-rounder this year -- but Miller will play early and often. The former walk-on had 96 catches and 18 touchdowns in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>Like I said after Thursday night, I didn't expect <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915189/roquan-smith\" target=\"_new\">Roquan Smith<\/a> to be on the board at No. 8, and he's going to become the face of the Bears' defense. He's not built like Brian Urlacher, but he's a sure tackler and sideline-to-sideline linebacker. He's also going to be a leader on an improving -- and young -- defense. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3124779/joel-iyiegbuniwe\" target=\"_new\">Joel Iyiegbuniwe<\/a> (115) is a hybrid defender who will make an impact on special teams. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3047582/kylie-fitts\" target=\"_new\">Kylie Fitts<\/a> (181) had trouble with injuries at Utah, but he can play a role as a situational edge rusher.<\/p>\n<p>This isn't a perfect class -- and that 2019 second-round pick sure could have come in handy for a rebuilding team -- but I like the players, and the biggest needs were all filled.

He's too talented. The Broncos' defense regressed in 2017 -- the Rams say \"thanks\" for Wade Phillips -- and ranked only 22nd in the league in sacks with 33. With Miller and Chubb on the field, they'll get after quarterbacks.<\/p>\n<p>Running back was one of the Broncos' biggest needs after C.J. Anderson was released, and there weren't many guys available at 71. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122672/royce-freeman\" target=\"_new\">Royce Freeman<\/a> isn't a big factor in the passing game, but he was the best back left on my board. He had 60 rushing touchdowns at Oregon and packs short-yardage punch at 230 pounds.

But <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122797/isaac-yiadom\" target=\"_new\">Isaac Yiadom<\/a> (pick 99) is a solid player and a big, 6-1 corner who should get snaps.

In fact, the Patriots had a focus on helping Brady out. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128713/isaiah-wynn\" target=\"_new\">Isaiah Wynn<\/a> (pick 23) has traits that say he might be better at guard, but he can play tackle. And if it wasn't such a crowded backfield, I'd peg <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128721/sony-michel\" target=\"_new\">Sony Michel<\/a> as a Rookie of the Year candidate -- he's an explosive SEC-tested running back who is scary in space. I'm typically down on first-round RBs, but he was No. 28 on my board, and the Patriots nabbed him at 31.<\/p>\n<p>The Patriots' defense -- the secondary in particular -- was thrashed too often last year, certainly in February, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115250/duke-dawson\" target=\"_new\">Duke Dawson<\/a> (56) could help. He's best when he can play press-man, and seems like an immediate help in the slot. Linebacker would be a major concern if I were a Patriots fan, and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116187/ja'whaun-bentley\" target=\"_new\">Ja'Whaun Bentley<\/a>\u00a0(143) at least has a chance to stick. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3123075/braxton-berrios\" target=\"_new\">Braxton Berrios<\/a> (210) seems cut from New England wide receiver central casting. No surprise if he sticks and finds a way to help -- though don't expect early returns.<\/p>\n<p>Every year we ask if the Patriots could have done more, but this team annually picks at the end of Round 1. You have to develop when you pick where they do, and to their credit, they do. The big question will be whether they could have used the Michel pick for needed defensive help.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"WAS\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><inline10-wide><\/p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/was.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/wsh/washington-redskins\" target=\"_new\">Washington Redskins<\/a>: B+<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Top needs:<\/strong> Linebackers, defensive line, wide receiver<\/p>\n<p>This is a good class, especially at the top. There was the biggest need filled with nose tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3925354/da'ron-payne\" target=\"_new\">Da'Ron Payne<\/a> at No. 13. The Redskins had the worst rush defense in the league in 2017, surrendering 2,146 yards. And now Payne gets to partner up with a (hopefully) healthy <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3054840/jonathan-allen\" target=\"_new\">Jonathan Allen<\/a>, another Alabama defender who fell to Washington in Round 1 last year. Remember that Allen was looking like a Pro Bowl player before he got hurt. That D-line could be tough inside.<\/p>\n<p>Then Washington upgraded its running game with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3843750/derrius-guice\" target=\"_new\">Derrius Guice<\/a>, my second-ranked back, who fell all the way to 59. Look, we don't know the exact reason why he dropped -- he has first-round talent -- but clearly teams were scared off by some questions. On the field, he's a really good player who can run over defenders with power and away from them with speed. When he replaced an injured <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115364/leonard-fournette\" target=\"_new\">Leonard Fournette<\/a> in 2016, there was no drop-off, and he averaged 7.6 yards per carry. Also, fun note from my friends at ESPN Stats & Information: This is the eighth straight draft in which Washington has drafted a running back.<\/p>\n<p>One of my favorite offensive tackles in this class is <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916414/geron-christian\" target=\"_new\">Geron Christian<\/a>, who fell to Washington at 74 . He's raw, but he could be a starter at the next level. Safety <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116152/troy-apke\" target=\"_new\">Troy Apke<\/a> (109) ran a blazing 4.34 40 at the combine, but he started only one season at Penn State. I graded him as a special-teamer and likely late Day 3 pick. Inside linebacker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115310/shaun-dion-hamilton\" target=\"_new\">Shaun Dion Hamilton<\/a> (197) has dealt with injuries, but he's a starting-caliber player if he can stay on the field. Defensive tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3929956/tim-settle\" target=\"_new\">Tim Settle<\/a> (163) is a sleeper because the best version of him is a guy who goes much earlier. I had a fourth-round grade on Mr. Irrelevant, wide receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115365/trey-quinn\" target=\"_new\">Trey Quinn<\/a>. That's a value pick at No. 256 for a slot receiver who caught 114 passes last season.<\/p>\n<p>This isn't quite an \"A,\" but it's close.

And after the season <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3925357/calvin-ridley\" target=\"_new\">Calvin Ridley<\/a> had at Alabama, I never thought he'd be available at No. 26. But then his testing numbers at the combine were just average, and he started to drop. Listen, you have to trust the tape with Ridley. He's an advanced route runner who just gets open, and that's against SEC defenses and some of the best defensive backs in the country. That's why making him the No. 3 wideout behind <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13982/julio-jones\" target=\"_new\">Julio Jones<\/a> (another Bama star) and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14922/mohamed-sanu\" target=\"_new\">Mohamed Sanu<\/a> is a great move. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11237/matt-ryan\" target=\"_new\">Matt Ryan<\/a> has to be elated with his options, and the NFC South only got tougher this offseason.<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere, defensive tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051376/deadrin-senat\" target=\"_new\">Deadrin Senat<\/a> (pick 90) could be a straight replacement for <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14939/dontari-poe\" target=\"_new\">Dontari Poe<\/a>, who left for the Panthers in free agency. Cornerback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915437/isaiah-oliver\" target=\"_new\">Isaiah Oliver<\/a> (58) is a supreme athlete who also returned punts for the Buffaloes. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3123969/ito-smith\" target=\"_new\">Ito Smith<\/a> (126) is insurance in case they can't retain <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2979477/tevin-coleman\" target=\"_new\">Tevin Coleman<\/a>. Smith is only 5-9, but he'll help in the passing game -- he had 140 career receptions.<\/p>\n<p>If there's a qualm with this class, it's that there's no guard, and they could have used a young guy to push the starters.

And my evaluations of Price and Iowa's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3894849/james-daniels\" target=\"_new\">James Daniels<\/a> were close, so this isn't a reach. Cincinnati had one of the league's worst offensive lines in 2017. It has already addressed left tackle with the addition of <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14971/cordy-glenn\" target=\"_new\">Cordy Glenn<\/a>, and I thought the Bengals might try to add some more tackle competition for the right side. But Price is a good player who I thought would drop to Round 2 because of a torn pectoral muscle at the combine. Clearly Marvin Lewis & Co. think he can be a plug-and-play center, and they need it after <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16876/russell-bodine\" target=\"_new\">Russell Bodine<\/a> left this offseason.<\/p>\n<p>After the first round, the Bengals did a good job not reaching and taking the best players available. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3919512/jessie-bates\" target=\"_new\">Jessie Bates III<\/a> (pick 54) is a good player with upside. I have compared <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121416/sam-hubbard\" target=\"_new\">Sam Hubbard<\/a> (77) to Rob Ninkovich as a Swiss Army knife-type player with versatility. He wasn't as productive last season as I thought he might be. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3821576/malik-jefferson\" target=\"_new\">Malik Jefferson<\/a> (78) is a true 4-3 outside linebacker who was inconsistent for the Longhorns. I heard from a few guys in the league before the 2017 season that he was a potential first-round pick, but I didn't see that on tape. Running back <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917846/mark-walton\" target=\"_new\">Mark Walton<\/a> (112) had a disappointing 4.60 40 time, and an ankle injury hurt him last season. I wrote about cornerback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3042785/darius-phillips\" target=\"_new\">Darius Phillips<\/a> (170) during the season, and thought he was a potential playmaker who could play in the slot. He had three pick-sixes in 2016. I compared quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3042749/logan-woodside\" target=\"_new\">Logan Woodside<\/a> (249) to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15168/case-keenum\" target=\"_new\">Case Keenum<\/a>, and I wouldn't be surprised to see him make this roster.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, this Cincinnati class lacks star power, but it's solid.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"HOU\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><inline13-wide><\/p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/hou.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/hou/houston-texans\" target=\"_new\">Houston Texans<\/a>: B<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Top needs:<\/strong> Tight end, offensive tackle, defensive back<\/p>\n<p>Houston dealt both of its top picks to the Browns -- one in the trade up for <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson\" target=\"_new\">Deshaun Watson<\/a> on draft day last year, and the other in the salary dump for <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14879/brock-osweiler\" target=\"_new\">Brock Osweiler<\/a>. So it's tough for a team to hit every need without those premium picks.

He tested well at the combine (4.40 40 and 4.15 20-yard shuttle). And he was versatile at Stanford, playing deep safety, corner, strong safety and nickel corner. With Reid\u00a0and the signing of <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15851/tyrann-mathieu\" target=\"_new\">Tyrann Mathieu<\/a>, Houston has upgraded at safety this offseason. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3894924/martinas-rankin\" target=\"_new\">Martinas Rankin<\/a> (pick 80) played left tackle in college, but he could move inside to guard or center in the NFL.

Fiedorowicz. He played a big part of UCF's undefeated 2017 season. The Texans got only two touchdowns out of tight ends last year. Houston grabbed another with\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035379/jordan-thomas\" target=\"_new\">Jordan Thomas<\/a> at No. 211.

He has been underrated throughout his career, playing on a dominant defense with tons of NFL talent. But he's physical, and he'll help in the box. The question was true speed, because we never saw an official 40 time throughout the pre-draft process. Wide receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115394/dj-chark\" target=\"_new\">D.J. Chark<\/a> (61) is the best deep threat in this class, but his tape was inconsistent.

Look at last year. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116593/dalvin-cook\" target=\"_new\">Dalvin Cook<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116385/joe-mixon\" target=\"_new\">Joe Mixon<\/a> went in Round 2, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3059915/kareem-hunt\" target=\"_new\">Kareem Hunt<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3054850/alvin-kamara\" target=\"_new\">Alvin Kamara<\/a> went in Round 3. Those are fantastic three-down backs with much smaller contracts than Barkley. Barkley will probably be great -- and the Giants haven't had a 1,000-yard rusher since 2012 -- but he's taking handoffs from a 37-year-old quarterback in <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5526/eli-manning\" target=\"_new\">Eli Manning<\/a>, who has been objectively pretty bad in recent years for long stretches.

I thought he could sneak into the top 40 picks after he ran a 4.50 40 at the combine. He's not a true pass-rusher, but he could play inside. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116748/bj-hill\" target=\"_new\">B.J.

He's going to compete with last year's third-round pick <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052600/davis-webb\" target=\"_new\">Davis Webb<\/a> to back up Manning, and maybe the Giants will find their quarterback of the future there after a couple of years of development. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917872/rj-mcintosh\" target=\"_new\">RJ McIntosh<\/a> (139) was one of my favorite underrated players, and he could be a steal. He's quick and athletic, and he has a motor. He'll probably play end.<\/p>\n<p>Again, I'm not going to crush GM Dave Gettleman's first draft in charge of the Giants.

And the Jets have to be thrilled that quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3912547/sam-darnold\" target=\"_new\">Sam Darnold<\/a> made it to them. Darnold looked like a lock to be the No. 1 pick after the 2016 season, but he had a shaky season in 2017, committing 22 turnovers (13 interceptions) and developing a few bad habits with his footwork. If he can get that corrected, watch out. New York would have a franchise passer for the next 15 years. If he keeps turning the ball over, it's not going to be pretty in the AFC East. Darnold needs to get back to his 2016 form -- this Jets draft is all about whether he's the answer.<\/p>\n<p>Without those second-round picks, it's tough for New York to fill holes elsewhere. And this is a team with several holes. The Jets filled a few in free agency, throwing money at cornerback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14989/trumaine-johnson\" target=\"_new\">Trumaine Johnson<\/a> and linebacker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16920/avery-williamson\" target=\"_new\">Avery Williamson<\/a>, for instance, but there aren't many playmakers here. Who is Darnold -- or <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3609/josh-mccown\" target=\"_new\">Josh McCown<\/a> -- going to throw to in 2018? I don't think <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14851/terrelle-pryor-sr\" target=\"_new\">Terrelle Pryor Sr<\/a>. is the answer, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2574808/robby-anderson\" target=\"_new\">Robby Anderson<\/a> has off-field issues. I did like the pick of <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4076951/nathan-shepherd\" target=\"_new\">Nathan Shepherd<\/a> at 72, an active defensive tackle who showed at the Senior Bowl against better competition that he belongs. Tight end <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3123050/chris-herndon-iv\" target=\"_new\">Chris Herndon IV<\/a> (pick 107) was rising up boards over the last few weeks. Cornerback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3041098/parry-nickerson\" target=\"_new\">Parry Nickerson<\/a> (197) ran a 4.32 40 at the combine and was a four-year starter at Tulane.<\/p>\n<p>As I said, this Jets draft is all about Darnold, but giving up three second-round picks to move up three spots is a ton. I think he's going to end up playing early.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"OAK\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><inline18-wide><\/p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/oak.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/oak/oakland-raiders\" target=\"_new\">Oakland Raiders<\/a>: B<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Top needs:<\/strong> Cornerback, inside linebacker, offensive tackle<\/p>\n<p>Two things are pretty clear to me in looking at this Raiders draft: They know that if they don't protect <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16757/derek-carr\" target=\"_new\">Derek Carr<\/a> they're in trouble, and they're willing to bet that new coach Jon Gruden and his staff can develop some high-ceiling talent that also comes with risk. The Raiders moved down in Round 1 and landed <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3134312/kolton-miller\" target=\"_new\">Kolton Miller<\/a> (pick 15), who reminds me of former Patriot and newly-minted Giants left tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13964/nate-solder\" target=\"_new\">Nate Solder<\/a>. This is a great athlete with a huge frame who projects as a good NFL left tackle if you maximize the talent. There's no guarantee. Third-round pick <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3072292/brandon-parker\" target=\"_new\">Brandon Parker<\/a> (65) is the same in that he's got the frame, but new O-line coach Tom Cable has his work cut out for him. Protect Carr and you're competitive, and with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/10062/donald-penn\" target=\"_new\">Donald Penn<\/a> now 35, it's clear that's the objective.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3843843/arden-key\" target=\"_new\">Arden Key<\/a> (87) has legit top-10 talent but off-field concerns that had him available late in Round 3. If Gruden and staff can keep Key focused, this could be a home-run pick ... but the risk is clear. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045220/maurice-hurst\" target=\"_new\">Maurice Hurst<\/a> (140) was off the boards of some teams because of a medical condition that arose at the combine. Again, this is a first-round talent at defensive tackle. I like the Raiders' willingness to place some bets. But I also just listed four players who all come with varying degrees of risk.<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3124574/nick-nelson\" target=\"_new\">Nick Nelson<\/a> (110) has a shot to help a secondary that needs bodies, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3054971/johnny-townsend\" target=\"_new\">Johnny Townsend<\/a> (173), my top-ranked punter, should fill in capably for the departed <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15389/marquette-king\" target=\"_new\">Marquette King<\/a>. At the end of the day, this draft might be defined by what Cable is able to do. And if Key is solid off the field, watch out.

The Bucs allowed 5.98 yards per play, which ranked last in the league. They couldn't stop the run, and they couldn't defend the pass. They made a few moves to address the defensive line in the offseason, signing <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14959/vinny-curry\" target=\"_new\">Vinny Curry<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16912/beau-allen\" target=\"_new\">Beau Allen<\/a> then trading for <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13256/jason-pierre-paul\" target=\"_new\">Jason Pierre-Paul<\/a>. And\u00a0they went defensive line with their first pick, adding mammoth nose tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3134362/vita-vea\" target=\"_new\">Vita Vea<\/a> after trading down five spots with the Bills. I was a little surprised the Bucs didn't go with safety <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3691739/derwin-james\" target=\"_new\">Derwin James<\/a> because he was still on the board, but I like Vea, even if tackle wasn't a huge need. He should eat up blockers next to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13240/gerald-mccoy\" target=\"_new\">Gerald McCoy<\/a>. GM Jason Licht and coach Dirk Koetter clearly identified the weakest spot on the team and fortified it this offseason.<\/p>\n<p>The Bucs added two second-round picks from the Bills in that trade -- those are two really important and premium selections -- and ended up picking four times on Day 2. Running pack <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3912550/ronald-jones-ii\" target=\"_new\">Ronald Jones II<\/a> (pick 38) could be an immediate starter. He has breakaway speed but wasn't used much in the passing game in college. Then Licht went with back-to-back cornerbacks in <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116679/mj-stewart\" target=\"_new\">M.J. Stewart<\/a> (53) and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916923/carlton-davis\" target=\"_new\">Carlton Davis<\/a> (63), trying to address that need in the secondary. Former first-round pick <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3054955/vernon-hargreaves\" target=\"_new\">Vernon Hargreaves III<\/a> has been a disappointment, so expect Stewart and Davis to compete right away. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3059021/alex-cappa\" target=\"_new\">Alex Cappa<\/a> (94) is a developmental prospect who was named Northwest Athletic Conference Offensive Lineman of the Year each of the past four seasons.

Last year he traded up for <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\" target=\"_new\">Patrick Mahomes<\/a> in Kansas City -- not at all a chalk pick at the time -- and this year he went with Mayfield, who lacks classic \"No. 1 QB prototype\" traits but brings elite accuracy, significant experience, and former walk-on moxie that seems to galvanize teammates. I would have drafted <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3912547/sam-darnold\" target=\"_new\">Sam Darnold<\/a>, and we'll all watch these careers play out side-by-side.

After <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16883/anthony-hitchens\" target=\"_new\">Anthony Hitchens<\/a> signed a big-money deal with the Chiefs in free agency, Dallas knew it needed to find a middle linebacker. After the Cowboys cut Dez Bryant earlier this month, they had to target a wide receiver, even with the signings of <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/17177/allen-hurns\" target=\"_new\">Allen Hurns<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15503/deonte-thompson\" target=\"_new\">Deonte Thompson<\/a>. They needed to figure out whether <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577302/la'el-collins\" target=\"_new\">La'el Collins<\/a> was going to stick at right tackle or move back to left guard. They needed a one-technique defensive tackle. And they needed a tight end, which looks even more pressing now with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4527/jason-witten\" target=\"_new\">Jason Witten<\/a> on the brink of retirement.<\/p>\n<p>So I can see what Jerry Jones & Co. did on the first two days of the draft. I had Bama linebacker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3126349/rashaan-evans\" target=\"_new\">Rashaan Evans<\/a> higher on my board, but I can't deny <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3138677/leighton-vander-esch\" target=\"_new\">Leighton Vander Esch<\/a>'s high ceiling. The Cowboys see him as a Rolando McClain-type middle linebacker, who can be a playmaker against the pass and stick backs behind the line of scrimmage. Vander Esch surged up boards after the combine, but he had only one great year of tape at Boise State.<\/p>\n<p>I see <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3821577/connor-williams\" target=\"_new\">Connor Williams<\/a> as more likely to move inside to guard, so that means Collins could stick at tackle. And that's a good value at No. 50 -- Williams looked like a top-15 pick in 2016 but dipped a bit on play and measurables -- his arms are a little short. I said on Friday night that Dallas grabbing wide receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4036348/michael-gallup\" target=\"_new\">Michael Gallup<\/a> was one of my favorite picks of the third round. He's an underrated player but don't expect him to replace Bryant. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3928979/dorance-armstrong-jr\" target=\"_new\">Dorance Armstrong Jr<\/a>. (116) had an injury-plagued 2017 season but had 10 sacks in 2016. You trust defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli to get the best out of him. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117256/dalton-schultz\" target=\"_new\">Dalton Schultz<\/a> (137) isn't going to replace Witten, but at least Schultz isn't allergic to blocking. I thought <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051381/mike-white\" target=\"_new\">Mike White<\/a> (171) could have gone late in the second round, so that's a good pick. If <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3126367/bo-scarbrough\" target=\"_new\">Bo Scarbrough<\/a> can play special teams, that's a good pick late in the seventh round.<\/p>\n<p>Where was the defensive tackle, though? That's still a weakness, and maybe Dallas can find a street free agent to play a role. And if Witten does retire, do they have a starting-caliber tight end on the roster?<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"DET\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><inline22-wide><\/p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/det.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\" target=\"_new\">Detroit Lions<\/a>: B-<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Top needs:<\/strong> Running back, defensive line, interior offensive line<\/p>\n<p>Matt Patricia's first draft as coach of the Lions could be defined by whether they finally find a consistent running game. The O-line and running back focus were clear. Detroit moved up eight spots to No. 43 (and surrendered pick 117) to take <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916925/kerryon-johnson\" target=\"_new\">Kerryon Johnson<\/a>, who had 20 total touchdowns last season. Johnson was my ninth-ranked back, and I had higher players on my board, plus the injury concerns at Auburn give me pause. There's no doubt that he's talented, but is he going to be a three-down back? Can he be relied upon in pass protection? Detroit finished last in rushing yards and yards per rush last season, so it's impossible to get worse. If Johnson can make an instant impact as a rookie -- and maybe break the streak of 68 straight games without a 100-yard rusher -- that deal might be worth it.<\/p>\n<p>Detroit helped the running game with center <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128689/frank-ragnow\" target=\"_new\">Frank Ragnow<\/a>\u00a0in Round 1 (20), and got a potential steal at 153 in offensive tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122687/tyrell-crosby\" target=\"_new\">Tyrell Crosby<\/a>, who played left tackle at Oregon and had a foot injury in 2016.

The best true blocking fullback in this draft should make that team. Safety <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3042499/tracy-walker\" target=\"_new\">Tracy Walker<\/a> (82) went higher than I thought he'd go, but the four-year starter impressed teams at the combine. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3126352/da'shawn-hand\" target=\"_new\">Da'Shawn Hand<\/a> (114) is a Patriots-type pick -- he has all the traits in the world to be a great player, and he could play defensive tackle or defensive end. The Lions gave -- who else? -- the Patriots a 2019 third-round pick to trade up to get him.<\/p>\n<p>The NFC North is a tough division, and a running game really matters. If Detroit found its workhorse -- and players to help him -- this could be a good class.

If Rams GM Les Snead and coach Sean McVay gave up a first-rounder for Cooks, they better be prepared to pay up to keep him, or else that's a bad trade. Still, consider that Cooks is just 24 years old, and no wide receivers were taken ahead of that No. 23 slot. It's certainly possible that they got the best wide receiver available. They gave up this year's second-round pick (No. 56) in the trade for <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16725/sammy-watkins\" target=\"_new\">Sammy Watkins<\/a>, whom they lost in free agency. That trade looks worse than the Cooks addition. The Rams spent heavily to try to upgrade their receiving corps, but there's better value in Round 2 of the draft.

When they took <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052885/mike-mcglinchey\" target=\"_new\">Mike McGlinchey<\/a>, though, we knew something was up because a starting offensive tackle wasn't a true need. That spot opened up later in the night as GM John Lynch dealt right tackle Trenton Brown (plus pick 143) to the Patriots for the 95th pick. So I see what Lynch and coach Kyle Shanahan see in McGlinchey, a big 6-8 tackle who is probably better on the right side. He needs to get stronger. His body type and feet remind me of <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/9641/andrew-whitworth\" target=\"_new\">Andrew Whitworth<\/a>, who has had a great career after being taken by the Bengals in the second round of the 2006 draft. McGlinchey was the name I heard as the biggest riser over the past two weeks.<\/p>\n<p>San Francisco didn't have its original second-round pick because of the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16760/jimmy-garoppolo\" target=\"_new\">Jimmy Garoppolo<\/a> trade -- I think they're OK with how that turned out -- but Lynch moved up in Round 2 (with the pick the Niners got from the Saints in last year's draft) to grab a pass-catcher for his quarterback. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3127306/dante-pettis\" target=\"_new\">Dante Pettis<\/a> (44) had 22 receiving touchdowns over the past two seasons, and had nine career punt return TDs, including four last season. He's an elite return man who immediately becomes a deep threat for Garoppolo. It did cost a third-round pick, but the 49ers had extras between the earlier Patriots' trade and the Bears moving up to get <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3039707/mitchell-trubisky\" target=\"_new\">Mitchell Trubisky<\/a> last year.<\/p>\n<p>With the uncertainty around Reuben Foster's future, I thought San Francisco might go after a linebacker early, but it waited until pick 70 to grab <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3138826/fred-warner\" target=\"_new\">Fred Warner<\/a>, a versatile playmaker who started 42 games at BYU. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116726/kentavius-street\" target=\"_new\">Kentavius Street<\/a> (128) is a powerful defensive end. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4039278/tarvarius-moore\" target=\"_new\">Tarvarius Moore<\/a> (95) was farther down on my board, but I see the athleticism on tape that could cause the 49ers to fall in love with him. Safety <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3043110/marcell-harris\" target=\"_new\">Marcell Harris<\/a> (184) missed the entire 2017 season because of an Achilles' injury, but he's worth a flier in the sixth round.<\/p>\n<p>There were a couple of reaches here, but we have to factor in the Garoppolo deal, too.

They traded up for all three of their top picks. The problem is that depleted their capital for the rest of the draft, and this team isn't without holes. Yes, Tennessee made the playoffs (and won a game), but I see a depth chart with aging edge defenders and issues at guard, tight end, inside linebacker and wide receiver. So the Titans ended up with only first- and second-round picks, then didn't have another selection again until the fifth round. They better hit on who they moved up for.<\/p>\n<p>As for the players they got with those trades, I do see the fits. The Titans moved up ahead of 3-4 teams Pittsburgh and New England for <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3126349/rashaan-evans\" target=\"_new\">Rashaan Evans<\/a> (pick 22), who will fill <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16920/avery-williamson\" target=\"_new\">Avery Williamson<\/a>'s spot at inside linebacker. Evans is an every-down player who can run with tight ends and backs, and he's a great fit for Tennessee's defense. I actually had pass-rusher <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122793/harold-landry\" target=\"_new\">Harold Landry<\/a> to the Titans in the first round in my two-round mock, and they moved up to No. 41 to get him in the second round. He's the best true 3-4 edge rusher in this class.<\/p>\n<p>I love the symmetry of former Patriot Mike Vrabel taking a quarterback with the 199th pick -- the same spot in which New England grabbed the greatest quarterback of all time. And <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052061/luke-falk\" target=\"_new\">Luke Falk<\/a> actually looks up to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady\" target=\"_new\">Tom Brady<\/a> and patterns his game after him. Falk isn't a great athlete, and he doesn't have the strongest arm, but that's what teams said about Brady in 1999. So, no, I don't think Falk is the next Brady, but he can be a solid NFL backup.<\/p>\n<p>Again, the aggressive day from Robinson's front office is noted. With only four picks, the Titans are going to have to hit on a few undrafted free agents, too.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"ARI\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><inline26-wide><\/p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/ari.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ari/arizona-cardinals\" target=\"_new\">Arizona Cardinals<\/a>: C+<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Top needs:<\/strong> Wide receiver, quarterback, defensive back<\/p>\n<p>The Cardinals were in the market for a quarterback.

He also has missed time over each of the past two seasons with concussions and a shoulder injury -- his throwing shoulder.

I thought he was a top-five player in this class, but teams got a little scared because he doesn't have a true position. He's a little bit of a tweener who doesn't have true safety measurables. The Dolphins just need to get him on the field. This is one of Nick Saban's favorite players ever. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116164/mike-gesicki\" target=\"_new\">Mike Gesicki<\/a> (pick 42) is going to slot straight into Thomas' spot, but he's not going to block anybody.

The Saints gave up a whopper of a package -- next year's first-round pick and a 2018 fifth-rounder -- to move up to take <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3124058/marcus-davenport\" target=\"_new\">Marcus Davenport<\/a>, a pass-rusher out of Texas-San Antonio.

The Cardinals did have to give up a third- and fifth-round pick to move up from 15 to 10 to get him, but earlier in the process it seemed as if they would've needed to get to No. 2 overall to land Rosen. He doesn't have the biggest arm, but Arizona will surround him with weapons (drafted WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3895856/christian-kirk\">Christian Kirk<\/a>, RB <a href=\"http://insider.espn.com/nfl/draft/player/_/id/102744/chase-edmonds\">Chase Edmonds<\/a>) and he has the ability to process information quickly and dissect defenses at the highest level.

Ridley is the best route runner in this class, and while his athletic measurements at the combine were subpar (31-inch vertical, 9-foot, 2-inch broad jump), he consistently wins in one-on-one coverage and gains separation. The Falcons will be able to use him outside and in the slot, and he should get a lot of single coverage with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14922/mohamed-sanu\">Mohamed Sanu<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13982/julio-jones\">Julio Jones<\/a> alongside him.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/bal.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens\">Baltimore Ravens<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><b><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3924365/hayden-hurst\">Hayden Hurst<\/a>, TE, South Carolina (No. 25)<\/b><\/p>\n<p><a name=\"BUF\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><inline1><\/p>\n\n\n<p>This was classic Ozzie Newsome. Few, if any, GMs have managed the NFL draft better than Newsome the past two decades, and he was in prime form again throughout Round 1. Baltimore traded back twice (from 16 to 22 to 25), picked up an extra third-rounder (TE <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116365/mark-andrews\">Mark Andrews<\/a>) and fourth-rounder (WR <a href=\"http://insider.espn.com/nfl/draft/player/_/id/101636/jaleel-scott\">Jaleel Scott<\/a>) and still got my top tight end in Hurst. Then Newsome used one of those picks and a 2019 second-rounder (sorry, Eric DeCosta!) to move back up and land a potential franchise quarterback in <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson<\/a>. While he is 25 years old already, Hurst is a classic flex tight end and will be Joe Flacco's safety blanket ... before he's Jackson's best friend.

Head coach Sean McDermott has a rich history from Carolina of having athletic linebackers that can cover, and Edmunds fits that mold. Only 19 years old, Edmunds ran a 4.54 40-yard dash at 6-4, 259, at the combine and has one of the best toolboxes of any prospect in this class. He's an immediate upgrade for Buffalo's linebacking corps.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/car.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/car/carolina-panthers\">Carolina Panthers<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4045305/ian-thomas\">Ian Thomas<\/a>, TE, Indiana (No. 101)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a name=\"CHI\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The Panthers continue to surround <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13994/cam-newton\">Cam Newton<\/a> with weapons, landing speedy WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915416/dj-moore\">D.J. Moore<\/a> in the first round and Thomas with the first pick of the fourth round. Thomas has upside as a flex tight end and is a good blocker inline already. He has overcome a lot to make it to this point, losing both of his parents and being raised by older siblings (he's one of eight) since he was 9 years old. He played two years at Nassau Community College before transferring to Indiana. He'll have a good opportunity to learn behind starting TE <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/10475/greg-olsen\">Greg Olsen<\/a>, who might not have many years left.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/chi.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears\">Chicago Bears<\/a><\/h2>\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3894849/james-daniels\">James Daniels<\/a>, C, Iowa (No. 39)<\/strong>\n<p><a name=\"CIN\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I love what the Bears did early in this draft, taking <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915189/roquan-smith\">Roquan Smith<\/a> at 8 and trading up to 51 to add a dynamic wide receiver (<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3050487/anthony-miller\">Anthony Miller<\/a>) for <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3039707/mitchell-trubisky\">Mitchell Trubisky<\/a>, but Daniels is the best value here.

A smart pick in a sudden need area for San Francisco.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/sea.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sea/seattle-seahawks\">Seattle Seahawks<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://insider.espn.com/nfl/draft/player/_/id/101715/jamarco-jones\">Jamarco Jones<\/a>, OT, Ohio State (No. 168)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a name=\"TB\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Seattle has a desperate need at offensive line -- stop me if you're heard that before -- so I didn't love that the Seahawks waited until the fifth round to address it.

Right tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2972304/germain-ifedi\">Germain Ifedi<\/a> led the NFL with 16 penalties last season, so there's a chance Jones pushes for the starting job.<\/p>\n<p>I'd be remiss not to mention <a href=\"http://insider.espn.com/nfl/draft/player/_/id/101691/shaquem-griffin\">Shaquem Griffin<\/a> as well.

But I actually think Vea complements <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13240/gerald-mccoy\">Gerald McCoy<\/a> well, and all of a sudden Tampa Bay's defensive line (which had an NFL-low 22 sacks in 2017) looks formidable. And this ultimately comes down to whether you'd rather have a player like <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3925345/minkah-fitzpatrick\">Minkah Fitzpatrick<\/a> or Vea, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916923/carlton-davis\">Carlton Davis<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116679/mj-stewart\">M.J.

Tennessee had five picks in the first three rounds last year, so this draft was about quality over quantity. I'm usually not a fan of moving up (as the Titans did twice), but their two biggest needs were edge rusher and inside linebacker -- and they knew Evans was going to New England at 23 if they didn't move ahead of the Patriots.

agency","byline":"Jordan Raanan","story":"<p>The NFL draft stretched three days and took in excess of 13 real-time hours for all the selections to be made. When it all wrapped, there were a total of 256 players selected by the league\u2019s 32 teams.<\/p><p>Then the real chaos ensued. The draft quickly transitioned into undrafted free agency, which in reality was already underway for several hours in a wink-wink underground way that only the NFL can cultivate.<\/p><p><!--photo1--><\/p><p>Undrafted free agency is where teams net additional players (the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/ari/arizona-cardinals\">Arizona Cardinals<\/a> added 24 this year) in hopes of finding the next Kurt Warner, Victor Cruz or Jason Peters. It begins before the draft is finished, and goes crazy immediately after the final selection.<\/p><p>It happens every year. There are significantly more NFL hopefuls than draft picks. This year, 336 players attended the NFL scouting combine alone. Hundreds more worked out across the country in hopes of an opportunity to make a roster. The leftovers from the draft sign as undrafted free agents, receive rookie-minicamp tryouts or are stuck banging on doors for a chance to prove they can play.<\/p><p>Wide receiver Jawill Davis is one of the 11 or so players who will officially sign with the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyg/new-york-giants\">New York Giants<\/a> as an undrafted free agent when he reports for rookie minicamp Thursday. He will be joined by dozens of rookies, with some veterans sprinkled in on tryouts.<\/p><p>Davis is one of several hundred prospects who waited to hear his name called in Rounds 6 or 7 before finally finding a team as an undrafted free agent around 7 p.m. on Saturday night after Day 3 of the draft, almost 48 hours after the Giants selected Penn State running back <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3929630/saquon-barkley\">Saquon Barkley<\/a> with their first of six picks.<\/p><p>\u201cIt was a frenzy for me. A long process. A long three days,\u201d Davis said in a telephone conversation with ESPN several days after the madness. \u201cThe days I was hearing [to be drafted] were Friday and Saturday that I could be going. In the later rounds, a lot of phone calls, a lot of teams expressing they want me to come play for their team.\u201d<\/p><p><!--inline1-->Davis played collegiately at the FCS level, for Bethune-Cookman. He caught 36 passes for 475 yards and three touchdowns. The 6-foot, 195-pound receiver ran the 40-yard dash at his pro day in 4.37 seconds.<\/p><p>Davis\u2019 conversations with team personnel led him to believe the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears\">Chicago Bears<\/a> might select him in the seventh and final round of the draft. The Bears took Georgia wide receiver <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035019/javon-wims\">Javon Wims<\/a> with their final selection (No. 224 overall) instead. It's hardly an uncommon story.<\/p><p>With family at his house eating and waiting to celebrate, Davis was in a similar position to many other draft prospects. He wanted to hear his name called but knew it might not happen. That would leave him in the wild west, trying to figure which team would provide the best fit.<\/p><p>Davis and his agent, Chris Martin of OTG Sports Management, had their phones ringing throughout the sixth and seventh rounds of the draft. In retrospect, it turned out those calls were in preparation for the post-draft madness.<\/p><p>Coaches, scouts, general managers and other team personnel get into the action. It varies by team. Davis was mostly in contact with wide receivers coach Tyke Tolbert in his dealings with the Giants. Tolbert kept calling throughout the later parts of the draft (the Giants didn\u2019t have a pick in the sixth or seventh rounds) to appraise the situation and make their interest known. Davis had also heard from veteran scout Jeremiah Davis throughout the process.<\/p><p>Assistant general manager Kevin Abrams ran the Giants\u2019 post-draft operation this year. It\u2019s a balancing act that can\u2019t satisfy everybody and can affect the number of desirable players added. Unlike the top of the draft, though, it\u2019s no-holds-barred with the undrafteds. They can sign with any team they please.<\/p><p>\u201cWe will target certain players that we want and we\u2019re going to do our best to go get them,\u201d Giants general manager Dave Gettleman said. \u201cI told you the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/17388/andrew-norwell\">Andrew Norwell<\/a> story, the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/17399/corey-brown\">Philly Brown<\/a> story, we\u2019ll do that. And that means -- you guys understand you\u2019ve got an undrafted rookie salary cap. You only get X amount of dollars that you can spend. So, we will use that as wisely as we can. So we will target guys.\u201d<\/p><p>Norwell was an undrafted free-agent signing of Gettleman\u2019s in Carolina. He developed into an All-Pro. Brown started some games at wide receiver for the Panthers. They were desirable undrafted free agents for Gettleman, which means they received sizable signing bonuses.<\/p><p>Each team received $103,856 this year to entice undrafted free agents with signing bonuses. They were free to use it as they please once the draft ended. That is when it got hectic.<\/p><p>Davis was among the Giants\u2019 targets. So were Temple safety Sean Chandler (who received a $10,000 signing bonus) and SMU center Evan Brown ($10,000). The Giants had them in their sights and remained in contact late in the draft while other teams were still making picks.<\/p><p>It\u2019s legal. It\u2019s part of the process. It\u2019s the final step, similar to college recruiting at the NFL level.<\/p><p>About 10 days to two weeks before the draft, teams really start working players. They call to ask what they\u2019ve been doing and who they\u2019re talking to. They want to determine which teams might be interested, where they can get the players, when they can get them and how much they can get them for. Information is power when it comes to the NFL draft.<\/p><p>Davis was among the lucky ones. He had upward of 10 teams interested in his services, but after discussions with Martin and a one-on-one with his mother, he made a decision: the Giants. He took into account which teams drafted receivers (the Giants didn\u2019t), their rosters, how much interest the coaching staff had shown throughout the process and what they were saying when they called. Everything mattered.<\/p><p>\u201cWe took all that into consideration,\u201d Davis said.<\/p><p>The bonus wasn\u2019t the only factor. It almost always is for players after the draft, especially when dealing with $10,000 here or there. But most understand that taking the most cash could be a shortsighted decision.<\/p><p><!--photo2-->More important is the opportunity to make the roster of the team they choose, which in turn would allow them to make significantly more money. It\u2019s why before, during and after the draft, agents and players are analyzing each individual\u2019s situation.<\/p><p>\u201cTrying to line up who has the most interest and who has the best chance to make sure they can stick on a roster,\u201d NFL agent Tyler Glass said.<\/p><p>Glass is a partner at G3, which represented three players in this year\u2019s draft. Monmouth center Alex Thompson and Syracuse offensive tackle <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3048635/jamar-mcgloster\">Jamar McGloster<\/a> signed as undrafted free agents with the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens\">Baltimore Ravens<\/a> and <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers\">San Francisco 49ers<\/a>, respectively. Youngstown State offensive tackle Justin Spencer earned a tryout with the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts\">Indianapolis Colts<\/a>.<\/p><p>With three players in the undrafted pool, it made for a crazy few hours and days this weekend at the G3 office.<\/p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I call the stock room in the '80s,\u201d Glass said. \u201cI have two phones; I have headphones. My brother is helping with calls. My dad is here. It\u2019s a stock room with teams. It\u2019s a madhouse.\u201d<\/p><p>That's typical of the undrafted free-agent process, which often draws criticism even from those inside the league. Hundreds of players agree to contract terms or accept invitations to tryouts in the span of a few hours. There are almost always players who back out of one or the other every year before it\u2019s said and done, which conversely leaves another without a contract or invite. How could it not happen, given the system in place?<\/p><p>Boston College tight end Charlie Callinan originally accepted an invite from the Giants. But when the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills\">Buffalo Bills<\/a> offered a tryout later, he elected to make the switch. Buffalo didn\u2019t draft a tight end and wasn't as deep as the Giants at the position. It was a no-brainer.<\/p><p>And then there are some just agonizing for that call. Safety J.J. Nunes played seven positions in his career in the Valparaiso defense. He has been relentlessly training for the past four months, but his school didn\u2019t have a pro day and he was shut out of several others. He\u2019s still hoping to catch a team's attention and get invited to a tryout.<\/p><p>When the dust settles after the draft, this is only the beginning for players, such as Davis, who didn\u2019t have their name called. After all this, now they have to get on the field and prove they\u2019re worthy of a roster spot. Given the minimal financial investment, nothing is given as undrafted free agent.<\/p><p>\u201cAs soon as I land in New Jersey, I\u2019m getting to work.

emerges as leading contender to host 2019 NFL draft","story":"<p>Nashville, Tennessee, has emerged as the leading contender to host the 2019 NFL draft, league sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>A decision is expected to be announced during the league's spring meeting May 22-23 in Atlanta.<\/p>\n<p>In the unlikely event that Nashville were to lose out on the 2019 draft, the city would be in prime position to then host the 2020 event, sources told ESPN.<\/p>\n<p>The other cities being considered as the potential host sites for the 2019 and 2020 NFL drafts are Las Vegas, Denver, Kansas City and a combination bid from Cleveland/Canton, Ohio.<\/p>\n<p>Butch Spyridon, the president and CEO of the Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp., told ESPN's Cameron Wolfe on Wednesday that the city encouraged the NFL to use the Ascend Amphitheater for the draft theater, Nissan Stadium (home of the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ten/tennessee-titans\">Tennessee Titans<\/a>) and its parking lots for the fan experience, and the Schermerhorn Symphony Center for the Titans' war room.<\/p>\n<p>Spyridon suggested that Broadway Street and First Avenue -- which is full of honky-tonks and includes nearby Bridgestone Arena -- be a big part of draft weekend as well. He also presented the Music City Center convention hall as a potential option.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, the NFL will create its own event based on the potential locations provided.<\/p>\n<p>Officials were told the NFL wants the draft to take on the personality of the host city, and that's when Nashville's representatives felt their chances improved dramatically because of the city's music-centric, party vibe.<\/p>\n<p>Spyridon said Nashville's slight preference was to host the 2020 draft because of minor logistics, but the organizing group has the flexibility and desire to host the 2019 draft if that is the NFL's choice.<\/p>\n<p>Spyridon said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" that Nashville would land the draft, putting odds at much better than 50-50.<\/p>\n<p>\"If we can embrace it Nashville style, we got a shot,\" Spyridon said. \"It'd be a big party. You'd know you were in Nashville. I promise they wouldn't be disappointed.\"<\/p>\n<p>The first televised draft was broadcast by ESPN in 1980, but it wasn't a fan event until 1995, when the league moved it to Madison Square Garden in New York.<\/p>\n<p>After a nine-year run at Radio City Music Hall in New York ended in 2014, the draft has been held in Chicago (2015-16), Philadelphia (2017) and Arlington, Texas (2018).<\/p>\n<p>This year's event at AT&T Stadium, home of the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Dallas Cowboys<\/a>, was the first to be held inside an NFL

combination of size and athleticism at the position. The 4.4-second speed is there, too. But I'm looking at the scheme fit in Los Angeles because it's a perfect match for James' skill set. With defensive coordinator Gus Bradley, James projects in that <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13336/kam-chancellor\" target=\"_new\">Kam Chancellor<\/a> role underneath. The closing speed is there, and so is the explosive power on contact. He can hit and track the ball in space. Plus, James has the traits to play over the top as a deep middle-third defender. You want upside and versatility in a defense that caters to the player? Man, this is it with James. I'm still shocked he was on the board at 17.<\/p>\n<p><offer><\/offer><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/den.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116733/bradley-chubb\" target=\"_new\">Bradley Chubb<\/a>, DE, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/den/denver-broncos\" target=\"_new\">Denver Broncos<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>With Chubb and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13976/von-miller\" target=\"_new\">Von Miller<\/a>, the Broncos have two bookend rushers to create chaos in passing situations. For starters, that's going to boost the secondary play in Denver. Remember, that ball has to come out when the quarterback begins to feel heat on the edge. And it's also going to impact protection schemes. Slide the running back or chip on Miller? I get it. But that leaves Chubb in a one-on-one matchup opposite the All-Pro rush linebacker. The NC State product graded out as one of the top overall prospects in this class. He's an impact guy. His arrival in Denver will allow the Broncos to work toward dictating the flow of the game from a defensive perspective once again.<\/p>\n<p><alsosee><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/ari.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3895856/christian-kirk\" target=\"_new\">Christian Kirk<\/a>, WR, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ari/arizona-cardinals\" target=\"_new\">Arizona Cardinals<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>It's the route running and toughness with Kirk. He can get open from the the slot, and there is enough long speed there (he ran a 4.47 40) to get on top of defensive backs in coverage. Smooth player on film. The Texas A&M star also brings top-tier return skills to Arizona in the kicking game. As a rookie, look for Kirk to benefit from playing opposite veteran <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5528/larry-fitzgerald\" target=\"_new\">Larry Fitzgerald<\/a> in Mike McCoy's offense. But as we take a peek at the future, Kirk can become that reliable, consistent target for quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3886377/josh-rosen\" target=\"_new\">Josh Rosen<\/a>. I believe Kirk will pile up receptions in this offense working in the short-to-intermediate passing game.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/ne.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128721/sony-michel\" target=\"_new\">Sony Michel<\/a>, RB, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots\" target=\"_new\">New England Patriots<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Michel might not log 20 total touches per game in the Patriots' backfield rotation, but we can't deny the fit in New England, given his running style and projected role as a pass-catcher. The Georgia star has that quick-twitch, downhill speed. Hit the hole, slice through gaps, and cut -- instantly -- to make defenders miss at the second level. Plus, I see upside here as a receiver out of the backfield. Get Michel involved on flat routes and angle routes, and use the screen game. The ability is there with Michel to beat linebackers after the catch, and those are the high-percentage throws we see from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady\" target=\"_new\">Tom Brady<\/a> in Josh McDaniels' offensive system. Work the ball underneath, and move the sticks. This is a good match for Michel's talent.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/chi.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915189/roquan-smith\" target=\"_new\">Roquan Smith<\/a>, LB, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears\" target=\"_new\">Chicago Bears<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>With the athletic skill set to fit today's NFL game, Smith is a plug-and-play linebacker for defensive coordinator Vic Fangio. Just look at the natural instincts to find the ball. Or check out the 4.5 speed in space. Smith can close in a hurry. And don't forget about his tackling technique. Wrap up, and put the ball carrier down. Smith should line up inside in the Bears' 3-4 base scheme, but I believe his biggest impact comes in their nickel packages. That's where Smith can get sideline to sideline, match running backs in the passing game or drop as a zone defender. Read the QB and go. The Bears got a blue-chip talent here.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/car.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915416/dj-moore\" target=\"_new\">D.J.

Feed Moore the ball underneath, use quick screens, and cater to his low 4.4 speed in vertical concepts. With the toughness and physicality to run after the catch, Moore is a solid complement to the big body of <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2977609/devin-funchess\" target=\"_new\">Devin Funchess<\/a>. Moore is aggressive with the rock, and Turner can put the rookie in position to use the playmaking ability he showed on his college tape at Maryland.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/was.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3843750/derrius-guice\" target=\"_new\">Derrius Guice<\/a>, RB, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/wsh/washington-redskins\" target=\"_new\">Washington Redskins<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Bring those big-boy pads if you want to square up Guice in the hole. The LSU star has a violent running style to push through the wash at the pro level, plus the footwork is there to slip defenders and find daylight. Guice should emerge quickly as an early-down/goal-line back in Washington, and don't discount his ability to provide some versatility as a receiving option in Jay Gruden's offense. With 4.49 speed, I believe Guice's game is a better fit in an NFL offense compared to the system at LSU. And there is no doubt on his talent level. He's a Day 2 pick with a first-round grade.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/gnb.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3895429/jaire-alexander\" target=\"_new\">Jaire Alexander<\/a>, CB, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/gb/green-bay-packers\" target=\"_new\">Green Bay Packers<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Green Bay's second-round pick, cornerback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3144984/josh-jackson\" target=\"_new\">Josh Jackson<\/a>, is also part of the Packers' blueprint to upgrade the secondary under new coordinator Mike Pettine. The former Iowa Hawkeye has crazy ball skills at the point of attack. But I'm focusing on Alexander because of his press-man skills and the competitiveness he shows in coverage. Yes, his technique will be tested early this season, but I love that he will challenge routes. Plus, the 4.3 speed is there to recover. Playing up in the grille of opposing wide receivers or getting his eyes on the quarterback in zone to drive on the ball, Alexander has a ton of upside in Pettine's scheme, along with Jackson and 2017 draft pick <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052170/kevin-king\" target=\"_new\">Kevin King<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/tam.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3912550/ronald-jones-ii\" target=\"_new\">Ronald Jones II<\/a>, RB, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-buccaneers\" target=\"_new\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Jones has the one-cut, slashing style to fit in multiple NFL offenses. That jump-cut is nasty, and there is home run ability on his USC tape, too. Hit the edge and go. Plus, Jones has the traits to emerge as a dual-threat back in the Tampa system. While Jones' smaller frame (6-foot, 205 pounds) could limit his total touches in the game plan, he filled a major need for the Bucs and brings the upside of a back who also can contribute quickly as a receiving option for quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2969939/jameis-winston\" target=\"_new\">Jameis Winston<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/ten.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122793/harold-landry\" target=\"_new\">Harold Landry<\/a>, OLB, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ten/tennessee-titans\" target=\"_new\">Tennessee Titans<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Landry slipped to the second round of the draft, but the fit works for new coach Mike Vrabel and the Titans. Yes, Landry fills a need here for Tennessee as a nickel edge rusher. But don't sleep on the upside with the Boston College prospect. His 2016 tape is legit. Natural speed off the ball and the flexibility to turn the corner as a pass-rusher. That first step can shock offensive tackles. Although Landry battled injuries and a drop in production last season, I see a prospect who can carve out a role in passing situations while developing his overall game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n"},{"images":[{"width":608,"name":"Josh Rosen [608x342]","peers":[{"alt":"Josh Rosen","name":"Josh Rosen [1296x1296]","width":1296,"id":23338989,"credit":"Ross D.

good debate","byline":"Josh Weinfuss","story":"<p>TEMPE, Ariz. -- <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3886377/josh-rosen\">Josh Rosen<\/a> likes a good debate.<\/p><p>It doesn't matter the topic, the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/ari/arizona-cardinals\">Arizona Cardinals<\/a> rookie quarterback has an opinion on it. Politics. Religion. Sports. Any of it. All of it.<\/p><p>While attending UCLA, Rosen, an economics major, lived with two political-science majors who were good friends with former Bruins center <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3047572/scott-quessenberry\">Scott Quessenberry<\/a>. As a result, Quessenberry spent a lot of time studying at their house.<\/p><p>Quessenberry and his friends would often start debates while sitting in the living room. Rosen, who would be in his room, was known to come out and join in. And it didn't take long for lines to be drawn. Sometimes it was fair, two versus two. Sometimes it wasn't, with Rosen taking on all three by himself.<\/p><p>\"Especially during the election season, my roommates, we would all get into it,\" Rosen said. \"It would get really, really heated, but it would never pass that point. It was always a lot of fun. I love debating, whether it be about anything, but I think it's healthy. It's like a lot to do with how to navigate life and whatnot.\"<\/p><p><!--photo1-->Rosen's intensity is part of what endeared him to his teammates at UCLA. His personality and outspoken nature became a topic of conversation in the lead-up to the NFL draft. But those who spent the most time with him in college described him as a \"great person to be around,\" \"laid back\" and the \"ultimate competitor.\"<\/p><p>\"All that matters is winning and being the best that we can and making our team the best that they can be,\" Quessenberry said. \"Off the field, he's a really good dude. He's always there. If somebody needs to talk to him, he's willing to listen. He always wanted to hang out with his teammates. Really, like a class act really is how I would describe him.\"<\/p><p><a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3134312/kolton-miller\">Kolton Miller<\/a>, the former Bruins left tackle and a first-round pick in the draft, has seen Rosen's evolution as a person and player firsthand. He was on campus as a redshirt freshman when Rosen arrived in 2015.<\/p><p>Sure, Rosen came in \"a little cocky,\" Miller said. But Rosen matured since his freshman-year antics into the Bruins' hardest worker.<\/p><p>He was \"really well-respected\" by his teammates, Miller said.<\/p><p>\"He's really well-rounded,\" Miller added. \"He doesn't try to be more than what he has to be -- a really good leader. I don't really have anything negative to say about him.\"<\/p><p>UCLA safety <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3117414/adarius-pickett\">Adarius Pickett<\/a> said Rosen's penchant for debates showed teammates another side of him, and sometimes taught them something in the process.<\/p><p>\"You never know when a debate will break out and it's always interesting to listen to him go at it,\" Pickett said. \"It's like he really can be a lawyer or something. He goes at it.<\/p><p>\"It's just funny to see because he's usually a really laid-back guy, but when he gets into those debates [he gets animated and I'm thinking], 'That's Josh? He's turning up like that?'\"<\/p><p>Rosen fine-tuned his debating chops around the Christmas dinner table at his grandmother's house in Philadelphia. Surrounded by his entire family -- his parents, aunts, cousins and sisters, among others -- it was tough to get a word in. Everyone was yelling at one another.<\/p><p>It became Rosen's opportunity to showcase his budding intelligence and his understanding of what was happening around the world.<\/p><p>\"You had to stay up to date on current events or you're going to get roasted at the table,\" Rosen said.<\/p><p>His parents, Charles Rosen and Liz Lippincott, preached the importance of academics while raising their children, but also the importance of forming, having and reforming opinions. Rosen grew up learning it was OK to change his mind. So when he has said things he hoped others would talk to him about  -- whatever the topic might be --  he would engage in debate and maybe even come to agree with the other point of view.<\/p><p>Before Rosen left UCLA, he talked with coach Chip Kelly about having a \"growth mindset\" and being open to constantly growing, evolving and improving as a person.<\/p><p>\"Anything I say in the media or whatnot, I hope people come up to me and say, 'That was actually right and wrong,'\" Rosen said.<\/p><p>During his introductory news conference a day after the Cardinals drafted him No. 10 overall, Rosen wasn't shy about talking about who he is -- opinionated -- and his desire to stay that way. But that's not new.<\/p><p>Jedd Fisch thought he and Rosen developed a good relationship fairly quickly when he was hired as UCLA's offensive coordinator in 2017, in part because Fisch not only gave Rosen time to share his opinions but because Fisch listened.<\/p><p>\"I liked to hear what he had to say,\" Fisch said. \"Everyone has opinions. Some people share them more than others. Some people ... what did Aaron Burr say to Alexander Hamilton? 'Talk less, smile more.' I think sometimes there is some value to that. I think there is some of that process that he's got to keep that in mind.<\/p><p>\"But, on the same token, you've got to appreciate Josh for his opinions and appreciate his mindset, appreciate how he works, appreciate that those opinions are not just out of left field. They're well thought out. I would listen to him and then, at a certain point in time, I'd be, 'OK, it\u2019s time to get back to football. We only have a certain amount of hours.'\"<\/p><p>Rosen said his coaches at UCLA used to call him a \"unique personality.\" Nothing could be more accurate. They also stressed the importance of staying true to himself.<\/p><p>\"That's one of the biggest pieces of leadership advice I've ever gotten, is to be authentic and to be real because you have to be the same guy every day and it's hard to be someone you're not every day,\" Rosen said.<\/p><p>That's who Rosen has tried to be on the field and off. He doesn't back down. The same poise and confidence Rosen has shown on game day translated to a debate. Quessenberry said he knew, when Rosen got to the line of scrimmage, he'd make the right decision and then make the right throw.<\/p><p>And when the two would get into a debate, Rosen was equally assertive.<\/p><p>\"He's kind of pushy,\" Quessenberry said. \"He kind of sticks his opinion in there. But I'm kind of the same way, so I'll stick mine right back and there's not a lot of leeway when we talk.<\/p><p>\"We believe in what we believe in and it doesn't hinder our friendship or anything.\"<\/p><p>Rosen understands his opinions carry a certain weight. But he also has begun understanding that he doesn't know what he doesn't know, and he believes that'll help as he begins his NFL career.<\/p><p>\"You've got to be humble when you know you're wrong and you have to courageously assert yourself as correct when you are,\" Rosen said. \"I think a lot of the smartest people in the world, they credit their intelligence to knowing that they don't know things, and I think that's something that I try to take to heart.\"<\/p>\n"},{"feedDisplayType":"Default","description":"Teams preach patience with rookie QBs but rarely follow through.

The <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/draft/news\" target=\"_blank\">2018 NFL draft<\/a> was just the third of the modern era to see five or more quarterbacks come off the board in the opening round, and while <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/23039883\" target=\"_blank\">there are no guarantees about their chances of succeeding<\/a>, history suggests that two or three of these quarterbacks will turn into franchise passers.<\/p>\n<p>In looking at why quarterbacks from the past struggled, I found that teams were routinely either disingenuous or naive about how long rookies would sit before being inserted into the starting lineup. Take the case of <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16724/blake-bortles\">Blake Bortles<\/a>, who had mechanical issues in college at UCF. When the Jaguars drafted Bortles with the No. 3 pick in 2014, they suggested they would <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlbertBreer/status/492311968108138497\" target=\"_blank\">give Bortles a redshirt year<\/a> to rebuild his mechanics. That redshirt \"year\" lasted until the second half of Week 3, when the Jags inserted Bortles into the lineup for a struggling <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11291/chad-henne\">Chad Henne<\/a>. Bortles hasn't left the starting lineup since, although his mechanics have ranged from effective to downright disastrous over that time.<\/p>\n<inline1>\n<p>Teams don't always regret moving up a time frame. The Eagles <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Sports_News/NFL/2016/07/25/Eagles-plan-a-redshirt-sideline-year-for-new-QB-Carson-Wentz/2181469478176/\" target=\"_blank\">planned to redshirt<\/a> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2573079/carson-wentz\">Carson Wentz<\/a> during the 2016 season, only to trade <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13197/sam-bradford\">Sam Bradford<\/a>\u00a0to the Vikings at the end of training camp and insert Wentz into the lineup after just 24 mediocre preseason pass attempts. Wentz looked great early before taking his lumps during an uneven rookie campaign, but by his sophomore season Wentz blossomed into an MVP candidate.<\/p>\n<p>In most cases, teams talk about caution in April and then can't wait to play with their new toy by the end of September. Let's be more realistic. We can't foresee injuries or trades like Philly's Bradford swap, but let's estimate the time frame for each of the five first-round quarterbacks given their landing spots and the quarterback depth chart. When are they likely to see the field? And, perhaps more important, when <i>should<\/i> they be inserted into the starting lineup?

Taylor is an unrestricted free agent after this season, so the Browns won't have much of a reason to be loyal to their current starter beyond keeping his market value high in free agency as a possible compensatory pick.<\/p>\n<p>If general manager John Dorsey gets a significant offer for Taylor before the season or even at the trade deadline, it would hardly be crazy to ship the former Bills starter to a new team. Assuming that Taylor sticks around, though, the right time to make a move with Mayfield would be after the Week 11 bye. Taylor and the Browns should have done enough by that point to distance themselves from the 1-31 stretch of 2016-17, and with six games to go, the Browns would have enough time to get Mayfield's feet wet and evaluate what he needs to improve in advance of being the full-time starter in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>The only concern here is the schedule, given that the Browns would be facing road games against the Broncos, Ravens and Texans to go with a home game against the Panthers. Unless the Browns want to sit Mayfield for an entire season, though, he's likely going to end up facing some of those tough matchups during his debut campaign.<\/p>\n<p><b>When he <i>will<\/i> be inserted into the lineup: Second half of Week 8.<\/b> Unless the Browns get off to a hot start and look like a viable playoff contender, it's unlikely that Jackson & Co. will be able to resist the urge to push their franchise passer into the lineup by the bye week. It would hardly be a surprise to see the Browns install some elements of the Lincoln Riley attack that Mayfield excelled with at Oklahoma, both for Taylor and for the reigning Heisman Trophy winner.<\/p>\n<p>Given Jackson's impatience with his quarterbacks, it makes sense that we'll see Mayfield enter into the game during the second half of a blowout. The most likely loss on Cleveland's schedule is in Week 8, when the Browns travel to play the Steelers in Pittsburgh. Giving Mayfield the second half of the game there also would make it easier to push him into the starting lineup for a pair of subsequent home games against the Chiefs and Falcons, neither of whom had above-average pass defenses last season, before that Week 11 bye.<\/p>\n<p><video2><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/nyj.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3912547/sam-darnold\">Sam Darnold<\/a>, New York Jets<\/h2>\n<p><b>When he <i>should<\/i> be inserted into the lineup: Week 1, or not until 2019.<\/b> Let me explain. The biggest concern about Darnold as he heads into the league is his elongated throwing motion, although the Jets obviously don't think it's going to be a huge hindrance. Darnold didn't make any changes to his throwing motion during the pre-draft process, but the Jets might decide they want to shorten Darnold's delivery behind what is likely to be one of the league's lesser offensive lines.<\/p>\n<p><alsosee><\/p>\n<p>If the Jets want to keep Darnold's motion as is, there's no real reason to stick <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3609/josh-mccown\">Josh McCown<\/a> in the lineup for some indeterminate amount of time before handing the job over to Darnold. Gang Green isn't likely to be competing for a playoff spot, and giving Darnold a full season to adjust his internal clock to the speed of NFL pass-rushers would be far more valuable -- especially considering Darnold's propensity for turning the ball over during his time at USC (22 turnovers in 2017).<\/p>\n<p>Alternately, if the Jets do want to work on Darnold's mechanics and reconstruct him as a passer, it's better to give offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates a full season to work on the third overall pick without worrying about Darnold coming in as relief for McCown. Of course, if the Jets do struggle, the duo of coach Todd Bowles and GM Mike Maccagnan will likely want to show off what Darnold can do before ownership decides on their future with the team, so that's an unlikely proposition.<\/p>\n<p><b>When he <i>will<\/i> be inserted into the lineup: After McCown gets hurt.<\/b> The Jets brought in McCown to serve as a placeholder in 2017 and got an impressive season, both in terms of performance and health. After suffering injuries in September during the 2014, 2015 and 2016 seasons, the 38-year-old veteran stuck in the lineup all the way until Week 13 before going down with a broken hand.<\/p>\n<p>Bowles understandably hopes that McCown will help develop Darnold during the season, but given McCown's injury history, it's likely that McCown will be forced off the field during the first half of the campaign. Once that happens, the Jets should push Darnold into the lineup ahead of <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16728/teddy-bridgewater\">Teddy Bridgewater<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3057986/christian-hackenberg\">Christian Hackenberg<\/a>, neither of whom are locks to even make the roster.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If McCown does stay healthy -- or the Jets get impatient in the nation's biggest media market -- it wouldn't be a shock to see Darnold make his first start during the Jets' three-game homestand in October, likely against the middling pass defense of the Colts in Week 6.<\/p>\n<photo1>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/buf.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen<\/a>, Buffalo Bills<\/h2>\n<p><b>When he <i>should<\/i> be inserted into the lineup: Week 13.<\/b> Allen is the biggest boom-or-bust quarterback in this class. While the Bills don't necessarily need to fix his mechanics, Allen will need to improve his comfort level in the pocket and patience in going through his progressions before making throws in places where only his receivers can bring in the football. That's going to take both time and meaningful NFL reps.<\/p>\n<p>Allen might end up looking great in the preseason -- as Bortles did back in 2014 -- but that shouldn't influence the Bills into pushing their top pick into the lineup early. Allen shouldn't be put under pressure to win games now as the starting quarterback for a team that made the playoffs a year ago. The Bills also have major concerns on the interior of their offensive line after losing <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12627/eric-wood\">Eric Wood<\/a> to retirement and Richie Incognito to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/68INCOGNITO/status/984964586293088256\" target=\"_blank\">occasional retirement<\/a>, problems they'll want to find a resolution to before throwing Allen to the wolves.<\/p>\n<p>The Bills have a Week 11 bye, but they come back in Week 12 with a home game against the Jaguars, who attacked quarterbacks like actual wolves last season. Inserting Allen into the starting lineup for the Week 13 trip to Miami leaves Buffalo with five games to go, none of which is\u00a0 likely to come against a team with an above-average pass defense. Three of those games are at home. If the Bills are out of playoff contention, Week 13 would be the optimal time to get Allen on the field under relatively friendly conditions.<\/p>\n<p><b>When he <i>will<\/i> be inserted into the lineup: Week 5.<\/b> The Bills are perhaps the most likely team in the league to regress in 2018, given that their 9-7 record was built upon an unsustainable 6-2 record in games decided by seven points or fewer. They also start the season with a brutally tough slate, including road games against the Ravens, Vikings and Packers and a home game against the Chargers, who beat the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2972236/nathan-peterman\">Nathan Peterman<\/a>-led Bills by 30 points last season. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16810/aj-mccarron\">AJ McCarron<\/a> is likely to begin the year as Buffalo's starter, but if the Bills get off to a 1-3 or 0-4 start, Allen could be in the lineup by the time the Bills get into their three-game stretch against the AFC South.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/ari.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3886377/josh-rosen\">Josh Rosen<\/a>, Arizona Cardinals<\/h2>\n<p><b>When he <i>should<\/i> be inserted into the lineup: When <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13197/sam-bradford\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Bradford<\/a> gets hurt.<\/b> Many observers regarded Rosen as the most pro-ready quarterback in this draft class by virtue of playing in a West Coast scheme under Jim Mora Jr. at UCLA. The concerns about Rosen are more about his arm strength and intangibles, problems that aren't going to be fixed if Rosen sits on the sideline.<\/p>\n<p>The Cardinals already have committed a minimum of $15 million to Bradford, a figure that will likely rise to $20 million unless Arizona trades him before or during the season. If a team offers a first-round pick for Bradford, as was the case with the Vikings before the 2016 season, the Cards would be smart to give that serious consideration. The chances of that happening, though, are relatively slim.<\/p>\n<p>Given Bradford's track record, everyone expects him to get injured at some point during the 2018 season. He has completed just three healthy seasons in his eight pro campaigns and has missed 37.5 percent of possible games since entering the league as the first overall pick. The simplest projection suggests that Bradford will suit up for 10 games in 2018. The first time he's hurt, though, the Cardinals should use the opportunity to replace him with the 10th overall pick.<\/p>\n<p><b>When he <i>will<\/i> be inserted into the lineup: When Bradford gets hurt.<\/b> This one seems pretty straightforward. Even if the Cardinals are competitive in a tough NFC West, Arizona is likely to turn things over to Rosen once Bradford is unable to play.\u00a0The Cardinals also have <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15837/mike-glennon\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Glennon<\/a> on the roster, but putting the former Bears starter into the lineup ahead of Rosen would be, as the UCLA product would put it, a mistake.<\/p>\n<p><video3><\/p>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/bal.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\">\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson<\/a>, Baltimore Ravens<\/h2>\n\n\n<p><b>When he <i>should<\/i> be inserted into the lineup: Week 1, 2019.<\/b> Jackson is more pro-ready than some observers might have you believe, given that he was <a href=\"http://theundefeated.com/features/lamar-jackson-louisville-could-change-the-nfl-if-he-gets-the-chance/\" target=\"_blank\">playing in an NFL offense for Bobby Petrino at Louisville<\/a>. Just about everyone agrees that Jackson needs to work on his footwork inside the pocket, which one hopes should improve the accuracy of a quarterback who completed 57 percent of his passes at Louisville.<\/p>\n<p><inline2><\/p>\n<p>In the short term, Jackson should have a part-time role as a dual-threat quarterback, where he should be absolutely terrifying against tired defenses for a snap or a series. With a veteran Ravens team desperate to make it back to the playoffs, though, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11252/joe-flacco\">Joe Flacco<\/a> likely offers a higher floor than a developing Jackson. Giving him a year of remedial work would allow Baltimore to rebuild Jackson's footwork while simultaneously allowing teams to prep for the 2016 Heisman winner by giving him a few snaps per game.<\/p>\n<p>The Ravens can move on from Flacco and free up $18.5 million under their 2019 cap by designating the former Super Bowl winner as a post-June 1 release, so unless Flacco excels under the threat of Jackson this season, the 2019 offseason seems like the logical time for John Harbaugh & Co. to make the change.<\/p>\n<p><b>When he <i>will<\/i> be inserted into the lineup: Week 1, 2019.<\/b> The Ravens moving up to draft Jackson shows just how exhausted this franchise is of the Flacco era, a run that has yielded just one playoff win since that Super Bowl victory following the 2012 season. It's also difficult to see Flacco playing poorly enough for Harbaugh to make an in-season change. Flacco's relatively clean injury history -- nine healthy seasons with a 10th ended by a torn ACL -- also makes it unlikely that the job will open up for Jackson.<\/p>\n<p>It's always possible that Jackson excels for a few snaps and the Ravens turn to him in the middle of a losing streak. Baltimore does have a stretch with three consecutive road games and four away games in five weeks from Weeks 4-8, followed by a home game against the Steelers. If they hit their bye with a sub-.500 record, maybe Harbaugh makes a change and hopes Jackson somehow saves Baltimore's season. Otherwise, the most plausible time for a change is next March.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n"},{"images":[{"width":576,"name":"Ian Thomas, Panthers [576x324]","peers":[{"name":"Ian Thomas, Panthers

path to NFL","byline":"David Newton","story":"<p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/4045305/ian-thomas\">Ian Thomas<\/a> was with his grandmother, sisters and brothers on April 27, all waiting for the phone to ring as the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/draft/news\" target=\"_blank\">NFL draft<\/a> went into its second day. They all wanted to be there to celebrate a moment that once didn't seem possible for the Indiana tight end.<\/p><p>Especially older brother Cliff Farmer.<\/p><p>Farmer legally adopted Thomas and two of his nine siblings when their father, Earl, died of a heart attack when Thomas was 9. It came a year after their mother, Martha, died from a kidney infection.<\/p><p>Farmer, 19 at the time, didn't want to see Ian or any of his brothers and sisters go into foster homes. He didn't want them caught up in the street life around their neighborhood in Baltimore, where many of Farmer's friends were killed before they reached 21.<\/p><p><!--photo1-->So he was there Friday night to celebrate Thomas' long, hard journey to the NFL.<\/p><p>The call didn't come -- at least not then.<\/p><p>It came Saturday when Farmer was on the job as a concrete finisher, where he began working for $200 a week when he adopted Thomas. He got the news from his uncle that Thomas was selected at the top of the fourth round by the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/car/carolina-panthers\">Carolina Panthers<\/a>.<\/p><p>\"I was disappointed I wasn't there,\" Farmer said. \"We were partying anyway [Friday] just for him to be in the draft. ... He's ready to work. I believe he will take on any challenge that is thrown at him. I have no doubt he will prevail.\"<\/p><p>But here's what Farmer missed by not being there in person.<\/p><p>\"Everyone is recording it,\" Thomas said on a conference call shortly after he was selected. \"I see some tears here and there, but it's great. Especially, where we came from and how far we've been. So that's a blessing in itself.\"<br />\n<h2>No interest in trading<\/h2><p>Carolina general manager Marty Hurney had several teams call after the draft's second day wanting to trade for the first pick of the fourth round.<\/p><p>Hurney didn't budge. He had a player in mind.<\/p><p>Apparently, so did one of the teams trying to trade up.<\/p><p>\"One of them texted right after and said, 'Well, we don't have to look to trade up anymore,'\" Hurney said. \"So I guess they were looking to trade up to take Ian.\"<\/p><p>That would be Thomas, 6-foot-4 and 259 pounds.<\/p><p>The Panthers have been trying for years to find a player to groom as a future replacement for Pro Bowl tight end <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/10475/greg-olsen\">Greg Olsen<\/a> and to play opposite Olsen. They hoped it was <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/13272/ed-dickson\">Ed Dickson<\/a>, but after four good-but-not-great seasons, they let him sign with Seattle in free agency.<\/p><p>They believe they have that player now in Thomas, considered the best of the second tier of tight ends in this year's draft class, a player who has been compared by some to future Hall of Famer <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/5362/antonio-gates\">Antonio Gates<\/a>.<\/p><p>Thomas is a long way from the shrine in Canton, Ohio. There was a time when he was a long way from the NFL, period. Besides losing his parents at a young age, he wasn't recruited by a Division I team out of Digital Harbor High School (Baltimore) and wound up at Nassau Community College -- initially for basketball.<\/p><p>He ultimately found his way back to football and transferred to Indiana as a junior. He caught only three passes his first season and 25 this past year, but showed enough athletic prowess to impress NFL coaches and general managers.<\/p><p>\"He definitely has the abilities to come and contribute right away, but we think he has got a very high upside,\" Hurney said.<br />\n<h2>'Dream come true'<\/h2><p>Thomas is quiet by nature, often answering in sentences of two words. He keeps much of what he's been through to himself and admits that as a kid he never thought the NFL was a possibility.<\/p><p>\"But as the years passed, and going through the schools that I've been through, having help from all the good coaches that I have had and having a great support system behind me, they have made it possible for me to believe in myself,\" he said. \"It's a dream come true.\"<\/p><p><!--photo2-->Alan Holmes, the athletic director at Digital Harbor High, has seen three athletes during his career that he knew were special right away.<\/p><p>One was a kid who couldn't escape trouble in Baltimore. Another was NFL star receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/4512/anquan-boldin\" target=\"_blank\">Anquan Boldin<\/a>.<\/p><p>The other was Thomas.<\/p><p>\"People are going to see they missed on a huge prospect,\" Holmes said. \"He's prototypical of the potential you can have no matter how rough your life is, that you can be a good human being and successful if you put your mind to it.\"<\/p><p>Holmes wasn't surprised Thomas didn't get much attention coming out of high school, but it had nothing to do with talent.<\/p><p>\"We didn't have a true high school quarterback,\" he said. \"Ian was catching balls because Ian had skills.\"<\/p><p>One play in particular showed Thomas' ability.<\/p><p>\"He made a catch in a key game against a program we hadn't beaten in years,\" Holmes recalled. \"He had a defender underneath him, a defender behind him. The ball was tipped by the underneath defender. Ian laid out, got both feet inbounds in the corner of the end zone and was able to bring the ball in.\"<\/p><p>Because Thomas is so quiet, Holmes only recently learned about all that Thomas had been through growing up without parents.<\/p><p>\"He really kept that stuff tight to the vest for a long time,\" Holmes said. \"It's all really coming out with this whole recruiting process with the NFL -- exactly what he had to go through.\"<\/p><p>Farmer believes the tough road will pay off for Thomas.<\/p><p>\"I believe it was meant for him to go that route, for him to really have to grind it out to get to where you want to be,\" he said. \"It wasn't handed to him at all.\"<\/p><p>Thomas can't thank his brother enough for getting him to this point.<\/p><p>\"He's always been telling me to stay cool and things will work themselves out,\" he said. \"What is meant to be, will be. I always thank him any chance I get for helping us growing up and for helping me become the man I am today.<\/p><p>\"He knows how much love I have for him and how much love he has for all of us. I know it's just a blessing to have him as an older brother and a role model.\"<\/p>\n"},{"originallyPosted":"2018-05-04T11:00:00Z","images":[{"alt":"Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott","width":608,"name":"Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott [608x342]","peers":[{"alt":"Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott","width":1296,"name":"Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott [1296x1296]","id":23395145,"type":"header","credit":"Rodger Mallison/Zuma Press/Icon Sportswire","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0503/r365204_1296x1296_1-1.jpg","height":1296},{"alt":"Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott","width":1296,"name":"Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott [1296x729]","id":23395133,"type":"header","credit":"Rodger Mallison/Zuma Press/Icon Sportswire","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0503/r365204_1296x729_16-9.jpg","height":729},{"alt":"Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott","width":864,"name":"Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott [864x1296]","id":23395149,"type":"header","credit":"Rodger Mallison/Zuma Press/Icon Sportswire","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0503/r365204_864x1296_2-3.jpg","height":1296},{"alt":"Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott","width":1296,"name":"Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott [1296x864]","id":23395138,"type":"header","credit":"Rodger Mallison/Zuma Press/Icon Sportswire","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0503/r365204_1296x864_3-2.jpg","height":864},{"alt":"Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott","width":1296,"name":"Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott [1296x518]","id":23395142,"type":"header","credit":"Rodger Mallison/Zuma Press/Icon Sportswire","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0503/r365204_1296x518_5-2.jpg","height":518}],"id":23395135,"type":"header","credit":"Rodger Mallison/Zuma Press/Icon Sportswire","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0503/r365204_608x342_16-9.jpg","height":342},{"width":576,"name":"D-line dominates top NFL prospects for 2019","caption":"Take a look at the top prospects for next year's NFL draft, led by dominant defensive lineman like Clemson's Clelin Ferrell and Ohio State's Nick Bosa.","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/media/motion/2018/0502/dm_180502_NFL_highlight_2019_top_prospects_with_stats/dm_180502_NFL_highlight_2019_top_prospects_with_stats.jpg","height":324}],"feedDisplayType":"Default","description":"What needs does your favorite team still have after the draft and free agency?

Between free agency and the draft, they added new starters at wide receiver, left tackle, left guard, running back, defensive end and linebacker. In the process, though, they traded <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13256/jason-pierre-paul\">Jason Pierre-Paul<\/a> to Tampa Bay. The long-term financial benefits of that move are clear -- the trade will save the team nearly $40 million in cap space over the next few seasons -- but in the short term it left New York woefully thin at the league's most important defensive position. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14982/olivier-vernon\">Olivier Vernon<\/a>'s 44.0 career sacks are by far the most of any player on the Giants roster. Defensive back <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/10613/william-gay\">William Gay<\/a> is next with just 7.0 sacks in his 11 NFL seasons. The outlook for Vernon is murky, too; he had just 6.5 sacks last season, and with James Bettcher installing a 3-4 base defense, Vernon will be moving to outside linebacker. Incoming rookie <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128715/lorenzo-carter\">Lorenzo Carter<\/a> had a great performance at the combine, but there is a reason he was available in the third round -- he never had more than 5.0 sacks in a season at Georgia.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"phi\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/phi.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Philadelphia Eagles<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Biggest hole:<\/strong> Special teams<\/p>\n<p>Nearly every starter on both sides of the ball will return from last season's championship team, and left tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/6012/jason-peters\">Jason Peters<\/a> and quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2573079/carson-wentz\">Carson Wentz<\/a>\u00a0will return from injury.

Donnie Jones retired after the Super Bowl, then un-retired, but then the Eagles released him. Perhaps Cam Johnston, a former Aussie rules player who spent 2017 on the Philadelphia practice squad, will join the main roster in 2018.

In the first round, the Redskins tabbed Alabama defensive tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3925354/da'ron-payne\">Da'Ron Payne<\/a> to plug their leaky run defense, and in the second they selected LSU running back <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3843750/derrius-guice\">Derrius Guice<\/a> to boost their own ground attack.

Washington didn't give up many yards to opponents' top receivers, and quarterbacks didn't throw Norman's way very often -- but when they did, they averaged 10.5 yards per pass, half a yard more than any other starting cornerback, according to Sports Info Solutions charting. Norman will be 31 this season, and he could be in for a long year if the league realizes how many big plays he can surrender.

The team now has a hard-earned reputation for lulling opponents into a false sense of anxiety; no Falcons lead is ever considered truly safe. The Falcons remain a talented, youthful team with Super Bowl potential, and they replaced their major veteran departures with their top three picks in the draft. The remaining roster holes may be at fullback and perhaps backup quarterback, and that speaks volumes about the breadth of talent on the roster.

Their 2017 pressure rate of 29.4 percent (according to Sports Info Solutions charting) ranked 23rd in the league, their sack rate of 5.2 percent was 27th, and no individual pass-rusher hit 30 total pressures. Their leading outside pass-rusher, Elvis Dumervil, is still an unsigned free agent. There's a fair amount of work to do. San Francisco is counting on a pair of first-round talents providing more oomph in 2018. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117258/solomon-thomas\">Solomon Thomas<\/a> made plenty of tackles in the backfield in the running game as a rookie but had some growing pains as he transitioned to the outside in his first year in the NFL. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2971275/arik-armstead\">Arik Armstead<\/a> was beginning to show serious pass-rushing promise before a broken hand ended his season after just six games. The 49ers likely will need career years out of both players -- or from last year's midseason pickup, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16873/cassius-marsh\">Cassius Marsh<\/a> -- if they're going to be a serious playoff contender in 2018.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"sea\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"floatleft\" src=\"http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/sea.png?w=110&h=110&transparent=true\" width=\"50\"><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sea/seattle-seahawks\">Seattle Seahawks<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p><strong>Biggest hole:<\/strong> Offensive line<\/p>\n<p>Seattle's failure to find a developmental quarterback behind <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson\">Russell Wilson<\/a> means ... oh, who are we kidding -- it's the offensive line. Again. All we really need to do is update what we said <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/insider/story/_/id/19310941/biggest-holes-fill-every-nfl-team-draft-2017-offseason\" target=\"_blank\">at this point last year<\/a>. Seattle now has given up 40 or more sacks in each of the past five seasons, the longest active streak in the NFL. They finished <a href=\"https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/ol\" target=\"_blank\">31st in adjusted line yards and 26th in adjusted sack rate last season<\/a> -- and that's with Wilson's Houdini routine making them look better than they were. And yet, they waited until the end of the fifth round before drafting a lineman, Ohio State's\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121417/jamarco-jones\">Jamarco Jones<\/a>. That's too late to really project him as an impact starter as a rookie -- and Seattle really could have used a pair of new starters in this draft class. To be fair, the Seahawks haven't entirely ignored the offensive line this offseason. They added <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15792/dj-fluker\">D.J. Fluker<\/a> -- depth for most teams, an upgrade at guard for Seattle -- and replaced offensive line coach Tom Cable with Mike Solari. They'll also get a full season from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11260/duane-brown\">Duane Brown<\/a>, acquired in a midseason trade with Houston. Another year of experience can't hurt <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3042738/ethan-pocic\">Ethan Pocic<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2972304/germain-ifedi\">Germain Ifedi<\/a>, either. Still, there's every reason to expect we'll be here next year, with Seattle once again needing to beef up the offensive line to keep Wilson upright and healthy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n"},{"images":[{"width":608,"name":"Earl Thomas [608x342] - Copy","peers":[{"alt":"Earl Thomas","name":"Earl Thomas [1296x1296]","width":1296,"id":23315401,"credit":"Jeff

Earl Thomas","byline":"Brady Henderson","story":"<p>SEATTLE -- The chances of the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/sea/seattle-seahawks\">Seattle Seahawks<\/a> trading <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/13251/earl-thomas\">Earl Thomas<\/a> diminished considerably over the weekend when he remained with the team through the second day of the <a href=\"http://insider.espn.go.com/nfl/draft/player?id=3400\">NFL draft<\/a>.<\/p><p>Another indication a trade isn't likely came Thursday, when general manager John Schneider said in an interview with Seattle's Sports Radio 950 KRJ that the team isn't trying to move its All-Pro free safety. Specifically, he was asked if the Seahawks are still \"actively\" looking for a trade partner.<\/p><p>\"Nope, not actively looking for that,\" Schneider responded. \"Nope.\"<\/p><p><!--photo1--><\/p><p>Asked if the Seahawks had looked to trade Thomas, Schneider said it's his job to consider everything.<\/p><p>\"The way to answer that is that we\u2019re not doing our job if we don\u2019t listen to everybody,\" he said. \"If you guys could sit next to me throughout the draft, you\u2019d be blown away with what you hear. You have to be ready to make decisions all the way through whether it\u2019s the first round, third round or fifth round with players that are on their restricted tenders that want to be moved, so there\u2019s names being thrown around all the time.\"<\/p><p>That's been a common response from Schneider to questions about a possible Thomas trade, which has been one of the more pressing topics of Seattle's offseason. It has persisted for several reasons.<\/p><p>Thomas is entering the final year of his contract and at one point mentioned the possibility of holding out if he didn't get a new deal, though his stance on that may have changed. This comes at a time when the Seahawks are reshaping their roster at the expense of some of their star players such as <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/14086/richard-sherman\">Richard Sherman<\/a> (released), <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/12762/michael-bennett\">Michael Bennett<\/a> (traded) and <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/13232/jimmy-graham\">Jimmy Graham<\/a> (left in free agency), to name a few. The <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Dallas Cowboys<\/a> also have known interest in Thomas. ESPN's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/blog/dallas-cowboys/post/_/id/4766363/the-earl-thomas-dream-might-not-be-over-yet-for-cowboys\">Todd Archer reported<\/a> that the Cowboys may continue to pursue Thomas before the 2018 season.<\/p><p>However, the best chance of a trade almost certainly came and went along with the second day of the draft. That's because a trade now would have to include 2019 draft picks, which wouldn't be nearly as valuable to the Seahawks since they can no longer draft an immediate replacement.<\/p><p>But it's worth noting that at no point have the Seahawks slammed the door on a possible trade.<\/p><p>The next question: Will the Seahawks extend Thomas before the season? Schneider was noncommittal when asked Thursday if he foresees any talks with Thomas' representatives about a new deal in the near future.<\/p><p>\"That\u2019s hard to tell. I mean, he\u2019s under contract for next year,\" Schneider said. \"From a timing standpoint, that\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to get into. But obviously, everybody loves Earl. We all know he\u2019s a Hall of Fame-caliber player. Like I said, he\u2019s the second player we ever picked here. He\u2019s just been a huge inspiration all the way through. The guys a tempo-setter at practice and overcame his injury, and he\u2019s been doing great ever since.\"<\/p><p>Thomas was the NFL's highest-paid safety in terms of annual average when he signed a four-year, $40 million extension in 2014, but he's since fallen to sixth, with teammate <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/13336/kam-chancellor\">Kam Chancellor<\/a> ($12 million) among those who have surpassed him. He first raised the possibility of holding out in an interview with ESPN from the Pro Bowl in January, but Schneider said last month that he's been told by Thomas' representatives that he won't hold out.<\/p><p>Is there any concern on Schneider's part that Thomas' attitude may change if he doesn't get a new deal before the season?<\/p><p>\"I don\u2019t think so,\" Schneider said. \"He plays the game 100 miles an hour. He only knows how to do this in one manner, and that\u2019s just all out. So no, I wouldn\u2019t think that would be a factor for him.\"<\/p><p>Schneider also said in the KJR interview that the team \"would love\" to extend left tackle <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/11260/duane-brown\">Duane Brown<\/a> before the season. Brown has one year left on the contract the Seahawks inherited when they acquired him in a trade with the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/hou/houston-texans\">Houston Texans<\/a> in October. The Seahawks gave up their third-round pick in that deal, which is why Schneider said he considered Brown to be, in a sense, a part of Seattle's recent draft class.<\/p><p>\"We had to keep looking over at that card too -- right? -- in the third round, like, 'OK, he\u2019s part of this too,'\" Schneider said. \"When we made that move, we were hoping to lock him up, have him finish his career here.\"<\/p>\n"},{"images":[{"alt":"","width":576,"name":"McShay gives way-too-early top names for '19 draft","caption":"Todd McShay could see next year's NFL draft being heavy on defensive players,

then agonized","byline":"Rich Cimini","story":"<p><!--video-->Mike Maccagnan attended his first <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3912547/sam-darnold\">Sam Darnold<\/a> game on Oct. 27, 2016, at the Los Angeles Coliseum, but he certainly wasn't there to scout the redshirt freshman. No, he flew cross country to check out the <em>other<\/em> quarterback, Cal's <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052600/davis-webb\">Davis Webb<\/a>, but what he saw that night from Darnold -- more important, what he heard about him -- would resonate for the next 18 months.<\/p><p>It culminated last Thursday when the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets<\/a>, blown away that Darnold wasn't picked by the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns\">Cleveland Browns<\/a> or <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyg/new-york-giants\">New York Giants<\/a>, happily took the former Southern California star with the third overall choice in the NFL draft. When he learned the Giants were taking <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3929630/saquon-barkley\">Saquon Barkley<\/a>, the Jets' general manager flashed a \"I-can't-believe-this-just-happened\" look to his right-hand man in the war room, Brian Heimerdinger.<\/p><p>It was one of those moments scouts and personnel dream about.<\/p><p>The Jets scouted Darnold so intensely last season that Maccagnan flew to the West Coast on four consecutive weekends to watch him play, twice returning on red-eye flights immediately after the game so he could watch the Jets on Sunday. From last September to April 15, the day of a secret workout on the Southern California campus, Maccagnan made seven Darnold trips to California. Each time, he left thinking the same thing: <em>We love him, but we'll never get him.<\/em><\/p><p>Well, they got him, and they believe he has the potential to develop into their first true franchise quarterback since Joe Namath a half-century ago. Here's a look at how it unfolded:<\/p><p><strong>Oct. 27, 2016:<\/strong> During pregame warm-ups, Maccagnan struck up a conversation with a member of the Southern California coaching staff. Unsolicited, the staff member started gushing about the 19-year-old quarterback who saved their season. The Trojans started 1-2, changed quarterbacks and now they were riding a three-game winning streak with the precocious Darnold in charge. You're going to want this kid in a year or two, the guy told him.<\/p><p>Maccagnan had heard of Darnold, but he really didn't know much about him. Now he was getting an earful from the staffer, who went on and on about Darnold -- how he dominated as the scout-team quarterback and how, upon his promotion, he got the entire team to believe in him in a short period of time.<\/p><p>Scouts live for this kind of intel, so Maccagnan filed it away in his memory bank. He returned to the business at hand, scouting Webb, but he couldn't help notice Darnold that night. He threw five touchdown passes in Southern California's 45-24 victory.<\/p><p><!--photo2--><strong>Sept. 2, 2017:<\/strong> This was a busy time in the NFL -- cutdown weekend -- but Maccagnan squeezed in a trip to Los Angeles to watch Darnold in his season opener against Western Michigan. He flew out shortly after completing the blockbuster <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/15811/sheldon-richardson\">Sheldon Richardson<\/a> trade, which netted a second-round pick -- one of three second-rounders they used six months later to trade up to No. 3 overall. Now a national sensation after his epic Rose Bowl performance, Darnold didn't have one of his better games, throwing two interceptions. The Trojans won 49-31.<\/p><p><strong>Sept. 9:<\/strong> Maccagnan returned to Los Angeles to watch Southern California in a prime-time game against Stanford. As usual, he sat in the stands, not the press box, giving him an up-close view of the action. He bought a ticket behind the Southern California bench to observe what can't be seen on TV: player interaction on the bench, body language and body build.<\/p><p>Most talent evaluators prefer the eye-in-the-sky perspective, but Maccagnan believes he can learn more about players from the ground level. Are they one of the guys? How do they handle adversity? On this night, he saw Darnold working the bench, congratulating teammates after big plays and providing energy in his California-cool kind of way. He threw four touchdowns against a tough defense, leading Southern California to a 42-24 win.<\/p><p>Afterward, Maccagnan took a red-eye so he could attend the Jets' season opener in Buffalo.<\/p><p><strong>Sept. 16:<\/strong> With a segment of the Jets' fan base hoping the team would \"Suck for Sam,\" Maccagnan was back at the L.A. Coliseum, scouting Sam. On this night, in a nationally televised thriller against Texas, his affinity for Darnold grew appreciably. The quarterback made clutch play after clutch play, including an improvised jump pass that made the highlight shows. What stood out was how well Darnold read three levels of the defense and how he anticipated throwing windows before they opened.<\/p><p>Darnold rallied the Trojans from a fourth-quarter deficit, pulling out a 27-24 win in double overtime. Afterward, Maccagnan made his way down to the field and stood about 20 feet from Darnold as he was interviewed by a TV reporter. The interview was carried on the stadium's giant screen, so he could hear everything that was said in larger-than-life fashion. The quarterback credited his teammates and talked about how they emphasized clutch situations in practice.<\/p><p>The takeaway: <em>So young, yet so poised.<\/em><\/p><p>The GM flew up the coast to Oakland, where the Jets would face the Raiders the next day. By now, after three consecutive Saturdays in La-La Land, Maccagnan was like the famous burger chain.<\/p><p>In-N-Out.<\/p><p><strong>Sept. 23:<\/strong> Maccagnan was back in the Bay Area, watching Darnold improve to 4-0 with a 30-20 win against Cal. There was no rest for the weary. It was a red-eye back to New Jersey to catch the Jets' home opener against the Dolphins. Mind you, the GM wasn't only focused on Darnold. He also scouted the other top prospects, including four <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052587/baker-mayfield\">Baker Mayfield<\/a> games. He had a lot of help, as the Jets' area scouts blanketed the quarterbacks as well.<\/p><p><strong>Nov. 18:<\/strong> With the Jets enjoying their bye, Maccagnan and Heimerdinger, the vice president of player personnel, used the free weekend to scout Darnold and UCLA's <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3886377/josh-rosen\">Josh Rosen<\/a> in the most anticipated quarterback matchup of the season. Darnold was outplayed by Rosen, but Southern California won the game 28-23. Afterward, Darnold, hailed as a conquering hero, stood atop a stepladder on the field, brandishing a sword and leading the school's marching band in song.<\/p><p>The Jets got a kick out of that. Rest assured, that scene never will play out at MetLife Stadium, but his future employers liked the way he handled the moment. He never acted like a big shot even though he was.<\/p><p><!--photo1--><strong>March 2, 2018:<\/strong> The NFL scouting combine. Finally, the Jets' brass had its first formal meeting with Darnold: the standard 15-minute session at night. Teams call it speed dating because it's hard to get in-depth in just 15 minutes. After pleasantries and small talk, they showed Southern California plays from last season, asking Darnold to break them down conceptually. He didn't blow them away, but it was a solid interview -- a good first date, so to speak. The feeling in the room was how young he appeared in person. He doesn't turn 21 until June 5.<\/p><p><strong>March 21:<\/strong> The Jets dispatched their top decision-makers to Southern California's pro day -- Maccagnan, Heimerdinger, coach Todd Bowles and offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates. By now, the league-wide buzz was that Darnold was going No. 1 to the Browns. In fact, Browns owner Jimmy Haslam was sitting in the stands with Darnold's family in what appeared to be a not-so-subtle message to the quarterback-needy teams in attendance.<\/p><p>Like everyone else, the Jets were impressed by Darnold's performance. In the pouring rain, he \"threw the s--- out of it,\" according to one scout in attendance. The Jets' contingent noticed how Darnold needed only a few warm-up tosses to get ready. Most elite quarterbacks have an elaborate prep period to get loose. Not Darnold. He spent much of the time hanging out with teammates, encouraging them during their drills. When it was his turn, he let it rip, parting the raindrops with soggy footballs that traveled at high velocity.<\/p><p>The Jets' takeaway: This kid exudes cool. But as they left the campus, Maccagnan & Co. lamented what appeared to be a certain fate: <em>We're never going to see him with the third pick.<\/em><\/p><p><strong>April 15:<\/strong> After weeks of trying, the Jets finally were able to arrange a private workout with Darnold. Incredibly, it managed to stay a secret until after the draft. It never got reported. Maccagnan, Bowles, Bates and director of college scouting Matt Bazirgan flew to Los Angeles and managed to conduct an early-morning workout on campus. No spectators, no media. Three wide receivers and a tight end ran routes for Darnold, who once again shined. Afterward, they went inside and talked ball for a couple of hours.<\/p><p>Once again, the Jets left campus with a hollow feeling: <em>Was this all for naught?<\/em><\/p><p><strong>April 17:<\/strong> Long time, no see. Two days after the private workout, Darnold visited the Jets at their Florham Park, New Jersey, facility. Six team reps, including CEO Christopher Johnson, dined with Darnold at a nearby restaurant. Darnold sat next to Johnson and the conversation flowed throughout the evening. They all had a good laugh when cocktails were ordered, as they realized Darnold still wasn't old enough to drink alcohol.<\/p><p>Darnold spent the next day at the facility. He met with Bowles, Bates, Maccagnan, the trainer and the director of player development. He also bumped into quarterback <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3609/josh-mccown\">Josh McCown<\/a> and they talked for a few minutes. The visit ended in Maccagnan's office. After an exhaustive scouting process, the GM had run out of questions for Darnold. His due diligence was complete. He wished him well and sent him on his way to the airport. Later, Bowles remarked they'd probably never see him again. They weren't optimistic about him falling to them.<\/p><p><strong>April 26:<\/strong> Draft day began with a stunner. Mayfield went first, followed by Barkley. Initially, there was silent disbelief in the Jets' war room, then handshakes and congratulations. Eighteen months after he first set eyes on Darnold, Maccagnan had his man.<\/p>\n"},{"images":[{"width":608,"name":"Royce Freeman [608x342]","peers":[{"name":"Royce Freeman

draft","byline":"Jeff Legwold","story":"<p>ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- Usually experience matters in the NFL draft because a full resume is easier for talent evaluators to break down for strengths and weaknesses.<\/p><p>Unless you\u2019re a running back. Then experience, carries and workload can be strikes against you.<\/p><p>Just ask <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122672/royce-freeman\">Royce Freeman<\/a>, the Oregon running back whom the Broncos selected in the third round of last week\u2019s draft. Freeman was productive at Oregon (three 1,300-yard rushing seasons), he\u2019s fast (a 4.5-second clocking in the 40-yard dash) and he\u2019s powerful (229 pounds).<\/p><p>But Freeman was the eighth running back selected, and more than one personnel evaluator cited his 947 carries in four seasons with the Ducks as the reason.<\/p><p><!--photo1-->\u201cI feel like all of that durability and all of those carries just reflected my productivity throughout my four years at Oregon,\" Freeman said. \"It is not often you get backs playing as many games or taking as many carries. I feel like the fact that I was able to do so proves I am a durable running back.\"<\/p><p>Broncos president of football operations/general manager John Elway said: \"Royce has obviously carried the ball a lot at Oregon -- he had tremendous production there. He\u2019s a big banger that we haven\u2019t had for a while ... what it shows to us is he\u2019s durable. He played a lot so therefore he can take that. At the end of his career, who knows how much that will shorten it, but it wasn\u2019t a concern when we took him.\"<\/p><p>Freeman is part of a select group of collegiate backs who topped 900 carries and moved on into the NFL. Mike Hart topped 1,000 carries at Michigan before an NFL career with just 71 carries. Ron Dayne finished his career at Wisconsin with a Heisman Trophy and with 1,220 carries -- believed to be the most in major college football history -- before seven years in the NFL (he never rushed for more than 773 yards in a season).<\/p><p>In his one season with the Broncos, Dayne said he had been asked about the effect of all those carries before he was a pro: \u201cHundreds of times, like the ball was a hundred pounds.\"<\/p><p>Steve Bartalo is second on the career carries list with 1,215 during his time at Colorado State in the 1980s. He now works for Raymond James and has coached high school football in Tampa for the past 25 years.<\/p><p>\u201cI thought at the time it would benefit me because it meant there wasn\u2019t too many situations I wasn\u2019t familiar with and it proved I could take hits,\" said Bartalo, who topped 40 carries in his first college game. \u201cIt was a benefit to have all of that experience, those carries.  I don\u2019t think it impacted me moving forward -- I just wasn\u2019t good enough.\"<\/p><p>Bartalo played in nine games in the NFL, for the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-buccaneers\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers<\/a> in a strike-shortened season. He said he believes most running backs simply want the ball.<\/p><p>\u201cYou want to play all of the time; you don\u2019t ever want to come off the field,\" Bartalo said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it enters into your mind if somebody is going to say later that isn\u2019t a good thing. But it is interesting as time goes by, it seems to be happening with running backs.\"<\/p><p>Freeman, who played in 51 games at Oregon and closed out his career with 1,475 rushing yards as a senior, has the most college carries for a Broncos draft pick since the team selected Montee Ball in the second round of the 2013 draft. Ball finished his career at Wisconsin with 924 career carries.<\/p><p>Ball lasted just two seasons with the Broncos, including 559 yards rushing as a rookie, but has publicly said his career was far more affected by his off-the-field struggles with substance abuse.<\/p><p>Elway said workload is a consideration in the draft evaluation of running backs but that the Broncos also try to gauge a player\u2019s health coming into the draft as well as his body type and strength.<\/p><p>\"[Freeman] was a guy we felt has a lot of football in him left to play,\" Elway said. \"We liked he had done so much.\"<\/p><p>\u201cI just feel like durability for a running back is very important, especially when you get to this level, and I have proven my durability,\" Freeman said. \u201c... Maybe if I played another position, in the offensive line or linebacker or something, people would say all those games were good for me, but I think it was good for me. Going back for my senior year was the best decision of my life for me as a person, and I\u2019m going to prove it was the best decision for me as a player, too.\"<\/p>\n"},{"feedDisplayType":"Default","description":"Penn State has the next undersized QB ready to take on the world, while Oregon, LSU, Ohio State and Clemson have draft doppelgangers of

will be the next <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052587/baker-mayfield\">Baker Mayfield<\/a>? Who will be the explosive playmaker to spin defenses in circles or the next pass-rusher to wreak havoc on quarterbacks? There are dozens of players who could emerge in the coming season. To help you draftniks get acquainted with a few of them, we've picked out 10 stars for the coming season who have football doppelgangers (or at least pretty darn close comparisons) who were high-profile selections in this year's NFL draft.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Penn State QB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3116172/trace-mcsorley\">Trace McSorley<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p><b>Pro:<\/b> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns\">Cleveland Browns<\/a>\u00a0QB Baker Mayfield (No. 1 overall pick)<\/p>\n\n\n<p>The next undersized flamethrower eager to prove the world wrong resides in Happy Valley. Most colleges that recruited McSorley wanted him to play safety because of his size (Penn State lists him generously at 6-foot), but he was tall enough to throw 57 touchdown passes in the past two seasons while leading a resurgent Nittany Lions offense.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>The doubters this coming season will ask whether McSorley can be as productive without <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3929630/saquon-barkley\">Saquon Barkley<\/a> next to him in the backfield or offensive coordinator Joe Moorhead (who became the head coach at Mississippi State) calling plays on the sideline. McSorley may not have the same fiery off-field personality as Mayfield, but on Saturdays he's a versatile playmaker who plays with an attitude.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><photo4><\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Oregon QB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert\">Justin Herbert<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><b>Pro:<\/b> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets<\/a> QB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3912547/sam-darnold\">Sam Darnold<\/a> (No. 3 overall pick)<\/p>\n<p>Neither Herbert nor Darnold are going to make scouts drool with any particular physical tool, but both may turn out to be the most well-rounded, prototypically sized quarterback prospects in their respective classes (the 6-foot-6 Herbert has a couple of inches on Darnold). Herbert, like Darnold, was a three-sport athlete in high school. They have nearly identical completion percentages in college. Herbert hasn't yet suffered the same turnover troubles that Darnold encountered at USC, but he hasn't had the chance to play a full season yet at Oregon.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><alsosee><\/p>\n<h2>West Virginia QB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/559556/will-grier\">Will Grier<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p><b>Pro:<\/b>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers\">Pittsburgh Steelers<\/a>\u00a0QB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116407/mason-rudolph\">Mason Rudolph<\/a> (No. 76 overall pick)<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Grier could post some gaudy numbers in his final season as a Mountaineer. He passed for 3,490 yards and 34 touchdowns a season ago in 10 complete games. He'll have his top target back in wide receiver David Sills. That duo -- much like Rudolph and former Cowboys wideout <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122449/james-washington\">James Washington<\/a>\u00a0-- are likely to be the Big 12's most dangerous big-play threat this coming fall. Rudolph throws the deep ball particularly well, connecting on 17 passes of 50 or more yards last season. Grier threw for 50-plus yards on a play 12 times last year, and that number could grow in his senior season.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Stanford RB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3931398/bryce-love\">Bryce Love<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p><b>Pro:<\/b> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyg/new-york-giants\">New York Giants<\/a> RB Saquon Barkley (No. 2 overall pick)<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Barkley's explosive power made him hard to bring to the ground and gave Penn State plenty of options on how to deploy him against Big Ten defenses. Out on the West Coast, Love was running through and around Pac-12 defenses at an even more productive pace. Barkley may have a few pounds on Love, but both run with a tenacity that inevitably leads to big plays and jaw-dropping highlight reels.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><photo2><\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Washington RB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3886818/myles-gaskin\">Myles Gaskin<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p><b>Pro:<\/b>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots\">New England Patriots<\/a>\u00a0RB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128721/sony-michel\">Sony Michel<\/a> (No. 31 overall pick)<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Gaskin is a smart, low-to-the-ground back who led the Huskies with 24 touchdowns during his junior season. Like Michel did during his time at Georgia, the Washington native uses great vision to help set up his runs and moves that make defenders look silly. Michel's impact in the passing game faded during his final college season, but both backs have proved they're capable of keeping linebackers honest by catching a couple of dozen passes out of the backfield on an annual basis.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Ole Miss WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4047646/aj-brown\">A.J. Brown<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p><b>Pro:<\/b>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/car/carolina-panthers\">Carolina Panthers<\/a>\u00a0WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915416/dj-moore\">D.J. Moore<\/a> (No. 24 overall pick)<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Brown has yet to make it through a season at Ole Miss with a consistently healthy quarterback. Moore knows how he feels. The former Maryland standout broke the 1,000-yard receiving mark despite a torrent of injuries to his quarterbacks. Brown has a chance to be the nation's best receiver in 2018 even if the Rebels struggle to compete through sanctions. Both he and Moore take advantage of sturdy frames to create space for themselves while running routes. Brown, slightly larger than Moore, will be a target worth watching all season.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Ohio State DE <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4040605/nick-bosa\">Nick Bosa<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p><b>Pro:<\/b>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/den/denver-broncos\">Denver Broncos<\/a>\u00a0DE <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116733/bradley-chubb\">Bradley Chubb<\/a> (No. 5 overall pick)<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the best carbon copy for Bosa is his big brother, Joey, who was selected third overall in 2016 draft. From this year's draft group, Chubb fits as a strong comparison because both fearsome pass-rushers used their speed off the line to overwhelm tackles and then a mixture of strength and athleticism to finish their trip to the quarterback. A strong year for the junior at Ohio State could propel him to be selected as high as his brother in a year that is jam-packed full of quality defensive linemen.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><photo3><\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Houston DL <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4039303/ed-oliver\">Ed Oliver<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p><b>Pro:<\/b>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/wsh/washington-redskins\">Washington Redskins<\/a>\u00a0DT\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3925354/da'ron-payne\">Da'Ron Payne<\/a>\u00a0(No. 13 overall pick)<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Oliver very well could have been a first-round pick this season if he wasn't just finishing his second year of college football. He and Payne are both capable of disrupting the passing game from their posts in the middle of the defensive line -- an added bonus from a position usually relied on more for its run-stuffing abilities. Oliver will remain the focal point for his hometown Cougars this fall (unlike Payne, who was surrounded by NFL talent on Alabama's defense), but he should be able to keep pushing around interior linemen in the AAC for one more year before turning pro.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Clemson DL <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4035483/dexter-lawrence\">Dexter Lawrence<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p><b>Pro:<\/b>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-buccaneers\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers<\/a>\u00a0DT <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3134362/vita-vea\">Vita Vea<\/a> (No. 12 overall pick)<\/p>\n\n\n<p>This is more of a mountainous duo than the Oliver-Payne combination. Lawrence is listed at 340 pounds, just a little shy of the 347-pound Vea. That kind of tonnage isn't supposed to move as quickly as these two guys are able to get off the line. Vea and Lawrence blew up plays before they had a chance to get started last season. Lawrence has the benefit this year of playing alongside a couple of other potential first-round picks who will force opposing offensive lines to make some tough decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>LSU CB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4035437/andraez-williams\"> Greedy Williams<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n<p><b>Pro:<\/b>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/gb/green-bay-packers\">Green Bay Packers<\/a>\u00a0CB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3895429/jaire-alexander\">Jaire Alexander<\/a> (No. 18 overall pick)<\/p>\n\n\n<p>The six interceptions Williams made as a redshirt freshman last season tied for the most in the SEC. He added 11 more pass breakups for the Tigers before opposing offenses figured out they ought to look elsewhere to complete passes against LSU. His production may dip in 2018 now that quarterbacks are more aware of his talent, which is something Alexander (five interceptions in 2016 and just one last year) will understand well. At 6-foot-2, Williams has better size than any of the high-profile corners taken in this year's draft, but his aggressive and ball-hawking style aren't much different from how Alexander played at Louisville.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n"},{"images":[{"width":576,"name":"Mason Rudolph [576x324]","peers":[{"alt":"Mason Rudolph","name":"Mason Rudolph [1296x1296]","width":1296,"id":23377827,"credit":"Roy K.

experiment","byline":"Jeremy Fowler","story":"<p><!--video-->PITTSBURGH -- The <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers\">Pittsburgh Steelers<\/a> didn't have to talk themselves into drafting <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116407/mason-rudolph\">Mason Rudolph<\/a>. The voices in the halls of Oklahoma State's campus told them to do it.<\/p><p>\"They come up to you and, man for man or janitor to janitor, and they're grabbing you and saying 'Man, this is the salt of the earth. This is one of these type of dudes.' That's exciting,\" offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner said.<\/p><p><!--inline1--><\/p><p>So Pittsburgh made the \"dude\" one of the its most important third-round picks in recent history.<\/p><p><a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady\">Tom Brady<\/a> was 36 years old when the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots\">New England Patriots<\/a> selected <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/16760/jimmy-garoppolo\">Jimmy Garoppolo<\/a> in the second round of the 2014 draft. Four years later, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/5536/ben-roethlisberger\">Ben Roethlisberger<\/a> is 36 and will have a player the Steelers considered a first-round talent inside his quarterback room.<\/p><p>Brady played long enough to force Garoppolo to San Francisco in a trade that affected the Patriots' future plans. The Steelers would love to be faced with such a problem. They'd gladly sign up for Roethlisberger playing another four years, and Roethlisberger himself told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that he\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/23378004/ben-roethlisberger-plans-quarterback-pittsburgh-steelers-another-3-5-years\" target=\"_blank\">eyeing another three to five seasons<\/a>, barring injury.<\/p><p>To be sure, Rudolph one day flashing a Hollywood smile at a media conference announcing a $137.5 million contract, like Garoppolo, is hardly a guarantee. He's a third-round pick that <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mason-rudolph?id=32462018-0002-5599-4271-c09bf8338e3c\">at least one NFL draft evaluation compares to Christian Ponder<\/a>.<\/p><p>But the presence of Rudolph has deepened the intrigue of a Pittsburgh quarterback lineage that features one Hall of Famer (Terry Bradshaw) and another destined for a bust in Canton, Ohio.<\/p><p>This feels weightier than last year's fourth-round selection of Josh Dobbs, who is talented but considered raw. The Steelers have begun drawing the walls and doors of a succession blueprint. They believe Rudolph's ability to anticipate throws is next-level good.<\/p><p>Rudolph -- described as a devout Christian and obsessive about football prep -- will be ready. In fact, he prayed for this.<\/p><p>\"I've gotta believe he would embrace the job and hang onto it as long as those two did if the opportunity presented itself in the future,\" said Brett Rudolph, Mason's father.<\/p><h2>No hobbies, just football<\/h2><p>Exactly what to expect from Rudolph is tough to decipher because of the draft's quarterback dynamic. Many around the league considered Rudolph the sixth-best quarterback behind <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052587/baker-mayfield\">Baker Mayfield<\/a>, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3912547/sam-darnold\">Sam Darnold<\/a>, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen\">Josh Allen<\/a>, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3886377/josh-rosen\">Josh Rosen<\/a> and <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson\">Lamar Jackson<\/a>. The Steelers disagreed, with general manager Kevin Colbert revealing Rudolph ranked as high on his board as the others.<\/p><p>Rudolph can point to 13,618 reasons why he disagrees, one for each record-breaking yard at Oklahoma State, which ran a vertical passing offense suited to Rudolph's skill set.<\/p><p><!--photo1-->\"It'll stick with me every minute of every hour from here going forward until the day I die,\" Rudolph said about being labeled as a second-tier quarterback in the draft process.<\/p><p>Rudolph is the son of an asset manager for a real estate investment firm, a private-school-educated child until the sixth grade. He attended a Christian private school before joining Northwestern High School and football powerhouse Rock Hill (South Carolina) to see how he stacked up, converting from receiver to quarterback after coaches saw the natural arm talent and mental makeup for the position.<\/p><p>Rudolph's brother, Logan, plays outside linebacker at Clemson. His father played linebacker at North Carolina. He learned football toughness from his family, which believes three different school environments helped Rudolph become well-rounded.<\/p><p>When Rudolph isn't commanding a huddle, he's commanding living rooms by organizing family activities. His strong personality comes out in both settings, his father says.<\/p><p>No hobbies, just football.<\/p><p>\"Doesn't ever seem to be satisfied,\" Brett said. \"I've told him that you'll have plenty of years later on to do things you couldn't do as an NFL player, but have no regrets. He's been pretty obsessive about being as good as he can be.\"<\/p><p>Rudolph had hoped to go higher than 76th overall but also prioritized fit. Teams that showed the most interest had aging quarterbacks: Patriots, Saints, Chargers among them.<\/p><p>None of those drafted a quarterback, but five teams in the first round did, which was hard for Rudolph. Privately, he felt his pro-style quarterbacking and ability to keep his eyes downfield and deliver would erase concerns.<\/p><p>Now he knows only one thing to do.<\/p><p>\"Prepare like I'm the starter whether that's the case or not,\" Rudolph said.<\/p><h2>Working to combat 'system' stigma<\/h2><p>Between Cowboys practices and film sessions, Rudolph would corral a few young assistant coaches and run through every call sheet, review signals, where plays came from -- \"football gymnastics,\" as offensive coordinator Mike Yurcich calls it.<\/p><p>One 10-play script might take 30 minutes when reviewing each variation or coverage possibility.<\/p><p>If Rudolph didn't have enough information, he'd press Yurcich for more.<\/p><p>\"He's the kind of guy you want to go to work with and go to a heated battle with because you know he's done everything in his capability to handle the moment he's stepping into,\" Yurcich said.<\/p><p>Work ethic is great, but Rudolph might log overtime to conquer the \"system\" stigma that exists with offenses in the Big 12, where passing windows are bigger than NFL cornerbacks allow.<\/p><p><!--video2-->That stigma irks Yurcich, who got a four-year close-up at a quarterback with the best \"sniper's mentality\" he has ever seen -- the ability to wait for plays to develop, eyes downfield, while a pass rusher closes in. Rudolph slides in the pocket at a \"masterful\" level, Yurcich said, has flawless weight transfer on deep balls and punishes intermediate zones. He concedes Rudolph's ability to throw on the run is \"average,\" but adds Rudolph can improve in that area because he's not a bad athlete (4.9 40 time at the combine).<\/p><p>The way he sees it, a Big 12 offense should be the least of the NFL's concern when top-10 picks the past two years (Baker Mayfield, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes<\/a>) quarterbacked in the Big 12 and Andy Reid, a West Coast offense disciple, giddily schemes up Big 12-style concepts each Sunday.<\/p><p>\"I don't see under-center, seven-step drops in the NFL. I see shotgun, I see spread sets, pick routes, Big 12 offense in the Super Bowl,\" Yurcich said.<\/p><p>Rudolph points out he had vast control of OSU's offense, pre- and post-snap, which will help him learn at the NFL level. He has already met with Fichtner over the weekend to talk football, Brett said.<\/p><p>The Steelers should feel like they got a first-round pick, Yurcich said, because that's where he belonged.<\/p><p>\"It boggles my mind,\" Yurcich said about Rudolph not being grouped with the quarterbacks ahead of him. \"I think it's a slap in the face.\"<\/p><h2>Not Big Ben's job to teach me<\/h2><p>The Steelers aren't about to cast Roethlisberger aside.  He was one of the league's hottest quarterbacks at season's end, averaging 346 yards per game over his last seven games in 2017.<\/p><p>Center <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/13250/maurkice-pouncey\">Maurkice Pouncey<\/a> told ESPN that Roethlisberger wants to play another three years, which would necessitate an update on a contract expiring in 2020.<\/p><p>Drafting a quarterback in the third round allows the Steelers to invest in the future without mortgaging the present. The pick isn't high enough to put the starter on some sort of notice unnecessarily, and the backup quarterback dynamic just got more interesting. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/15904/landry-jones\">Landry Jones<\/a> is in the final year of his contract, and Dobbs has barely played. He'll want a chance.<\/p><p><!--photo2-->\"I know you can\u2019t keep four, but any coach is going to say 'give me as much talent as you possibly can,'\" said Fichtner, a former quarterbacks coach promoted in January after the team did not renew Todd Haley's contract. \"I am going to be excited as hell about this. I keep my fingers crossed that [Roethlisberger] will play as long as, Lord willing, he\u2019s healthy and that he wants to play. That\u2019d be awesome and that\u2019d be great for us. \u0085 If it takes three guys in competition to replace him some day, then so be it, and what a better position to be in right now and to keep developing quarterbacks.\"<\/p><p>That leaves Rudolph seeking a sweet spot between confidence and patience. Rudolph calls himself \"competitive to the bone\" and would love to play but also sees the value in development.<\/p><p>His reps will be limited to organized team activities, training camp, possibly a preseason start and no guarantees after that.<\/p><p>All this would be new for a player who has long admired Roethlisberger's game but plans to create his own NFL identity.<\/p><p>\"It\u2019s not Ben [Roethlisberger's] job to teach me anything. It\u2019s my job to learn and that is the way I am going to look at it,\" Rudolph said. \"Obviously, you\u2019re sitting behind an unbelievable player and a good dude, so we\u2019ll just kind of take it day by day and try to learn what I can each and every day.\"<\/p>\n"},{"images":[{"alt":"","width":576,"name":"How the 129th pick was made in London","caption":"Behind the scenes with the

emerges as leading contender to host 2019 NFL draft","story":"<p>Nashville, Tennessee, has emerged as the leading contender to host the 2019 NFL draft, league sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>A decision is expected to be announced during the league's spring meeting May 22-23 in Atlanta.<\/p>\n<p>In the unlikely event that Nashville were to lose out on the 2019 draft, the city would be in prime position to then host the 2020 event, sources told ESPN.<\/p>\n<p>The other cities being considered as the potential host sites for the 2019 and 2020 NFL drafts are Las Vegas, Denver, Kansas City and a combination bid from Cleveland/Canton, Ohio.<\/p>\n<p>Butch Spyridon, the president and CEO of the Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp., told ESPN's Cameron Wolfe on Wednesday that the city encouraged the NFL to use the Ascend Amphitheater for the draft theater, Nissan Stadium (home of the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ten/tennessee-titans\">Tennessee Titans<\/a>) and its parking lots for the fan experience, and the Schermerhorn Symphony Center for the Titans' war room.<\/p>\n<p>Spyridon suggested that Broadway Street and First Avenue -- which is full of honky-tonks and includes nearby Bridgestone Arena -- be a big part of draft weekend as well. He also presented the Music City Center convention hall as a potential option.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, the NFL will create its own event based on the potential locations provided.<\/p>\n<p>Officials were told the NFL wants the draft to take on the personality of the host city, and that's when Nashville's representatives felt their chances improved dramatically because of the city's music-centric, party vibe.<\/p>\n<p>Spyridon said Nashville's slight preference was to host the 2020 draft because of minor logistics, but the organizing group has the flexibility and desire to host the 2019 draft if that is the NFL's choice.<\/p>\n<p>Spyridon said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" that Nashville would land the draft, putting odds at much better than 50-50.<\/p>\n<p>\"If we can embrace it Nashville style, we got a shot,\" Spyridon said. \"It'd be a big party. You'd know you were in Nashville. I promise they wouldn't be disappointed.\"<\/p>\n<p>The first televised draft was broadcast by ESPN in 1980, but it wasn't a fan event until 1995, when the league moved it to Madison Square Garden in New York.<\/p>\n<p>After a nine-year run at Radio City Music Hall in New York ended in 2014, the draft has been held in Chicago (2015-16), Philadelphia (2017) and Arlington, Texas (2018).<\/p>\n<p>This year's event at AT&T Stadium, home of the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Dallas Cowboys<\/a>, was the first to be held inside an NFL stadium.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n"},{"images":[{"width":600,"name":"Baker Mayfield [600x400]","peers":[{"width":1296,"name":"Baker Mayfield [1296x1296]","id":21891809,"type":"header","credit":"AP Photo/Ron

You just evaluate the player and we think Danny has some decent traits and some decent qualities to work with, so we'll put him in our program and see how he does.\"<\/p>\n<p>As is the case for all seventh-round picks, the 6-foot-3, 222-pound Etling faces longer odds to emerge. As a senior at LSU in 2017, he went 165-of-275 passing for 2,463 yards, with 16 touchdowns and two interceptions (one was a Hail Mary).<\/p>\n<p>Etling is an older rookie, as he turns 24 in July, which is a result of having to sit out the 2015 season after transferring from Purdue to LSU. A native of Terre Haute, Indiana, who grew up an <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts\">Indianapolis Colts<\/a> fan, he was a coveted recruit out of high school. He started 12 games over two seasons at Purdue (2013-2014), losing the starting job, which led him to transfer.<\/p>\n<p>Etling said playing at LSU, under former NFL head coach/coordinator Cam Cameron in a pro-style offense, helped him progress. In addition, he said he has played in four different offensive systems under four coordinators, which has helped him adapt.<\/p>\n<p>Asked his strengths as a quarterback, he said, \"I'm just going to make sure that I'm always going to lead the offense, make sure that I understand that I'm the CEO when I'm out there on the field and move the chains, get the offense in the right play and be accurate with the football, and continue to improve always. Just making sure, some way, somehow, I'm always doing my job and to the best of my ability.\"<\/p>\n<p>Although he has never met Brady, Etling has a notable link to him from recently working with his throwing coach, Tom House.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n"},{"images":[{"width":600,"name":"Jordan Mailata [600x400]","peers":[{"width":1296,"name":"Jordan Mailata [1296x1296]","id":23349164,"type":"header","credit":"Doug Benc/AP Images","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0428/r363014_1296x1296_1-1.jpg","height":1296},{"width":1296,"name":"Jordan Mailata [1296x729]","id":23349148,"type":"header","credit":"Doug Benc/AP Images","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0428/r363014_1296x729_16-9.jpg","height":729},{"width":864,"name":"Jordan Mailata [864x1296]","id":23349153,"type":"header","credit":"Doug Benc/AP Images","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0428/r363014_864x1296_2-3.jpg","height":1296},{"width":1296,"name":"Jordan Mailata [1296x864]","id":23349157,"type":"header","credit":"Doug Benc/AP Images","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0428/r363014_1296x864_3-2.jpg","height":864},{"width":1296,"name":"Jordan Mailata [1296x518]","id":23349161,"type":"header","credit":"Doug Benc/AP Images","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0428/r363014_1296x518_5-2.jpg","height":518}],"id":23349159,"type":"header","credit":"Doug Benc/AP Images","url":"http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2018/0428/r363014_600x400_3-2.jpg","height":400}],"feedDisplayType":"Default","description":"With their final pick of the 2018 NFL draft, the Eagles selected Jordan Mailata, a 6-foot-8, 346-pound offensive tackle prospect from Australia with no football experience.","section":"NFL","categorized":"2018-04-28T22:50:05Z","linkText":"Eagles take rugby leaguer with no football past","allowAMP":true,"published":"2018-04-28T22:50:05Z","type":"HeadlineNews","allowComments":true,"premium":false,"nowId":"1-23349066","related":[{"images":[{"alt":"Nick Foles and Carson Wentz","width":608,"name":"Nick Foles and Carson Wentz [608x342]","peers":[{"alt":"Nick Foles and Carson Wentz","width":1296,"name":"Nick Foles and Carson Wentz [1296x1296]","caption":"Quarterbacks Nick Foles and Carson Wentz were both a big part of why the Eagles won a championship.","id":22334372,"type":"header","credit":"TIMOTHY A.

Watch some of his rugby league tape for the South Sydney Rabbitohs, and you'll see a big, fast, athletic dynamo trucking his competition. It's to be determined how his transition to the gridiron will go, but the tools are obvious.<\/p>\n<p>His journey began last summer when his agent decided to create a highlight reel to try to entice any other rugby clubs. He also sent them to a connection with the NFL's International Player Pathway program, who was intrigued.<\/p>\n<p>A November workout in Los Angeles led to Mailata being selected to train at IMG in Florida. He has labored there for the past several months, averaging four-and-a-half hours a day of training and an additional three hours of board and film work to learn the game.<\/p>\n<p><inline1><\/p>\n<p>Asked about his knowledge of football before this program, Mailata said, \"Mate, as little as peanuts.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"The last three or four months have not been easy at all,\" he said. \"Mentally challenging as well as physically. Trying to understand the basics and the fundamentals of football has been a great task. Little knowledge before I came in, but I can happily say now that I can understand concepts and a beginning to have a step in the right direction.\"<\/p>\n<p>He held his own pro day at IMG. It was co-led by Eagles offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland, who Mailata felt was \"challenging my manhood\" with all that he asked of him.<\/p>\n<p>\"But he gave me the thumbs up at the end of the session and said I had an outstanding session, an outstanding workout,\" Mailata said.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>He earned Stoutland's respect throughout the process. The key is that Stoutland determined that he was coachable.<\/p>\n<p>Mailata ran a 5.12-second 40-yard dash at his pro day, which would have ranked eighth among offensive linemen at the combine. From there, seven teams brought him in for a visit: the Eagles, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/wsh/washington-redskins\">Washington Redskins<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-browns\">Cleveland Browns<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers\">Los Angeles Chargers<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-falcons\">Atlanta Falcons<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts\">Indianapolis Colts<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets<\/a>. Philly was the one that grabbed him.<\/p>\n<p>It's to be determined how this experiment will go, but Mailata says he is not turning back.<\/p>\n<p>\"I knew that I was going to be giving this my all, because walking away from something I knew that well to go into something that was very foreign was a big risk to take,\" he said. \"So I was definitely all-in when I made my

Brady, goes to Titans with pick No. 199","byline":"Cameron Wolfe","story":"<p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- No pressure, <a href=\"http://insider.espn.com/nfl/draft/player/_/id/101541\">Luke Falk<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There will now be a link between Falk and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady\">Tom Brady<\/a> for the rest of the former's career after the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ten/tennessee-titans\">Titans<\/a> selected him with the 199th overall pick Saturday -- the same one\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ne/new-england-patriots\">New England<\/a> used on its future Hall of Famer in 2000.<\/p>\n<p>The similarities between the two quarterbacks don't just stop with the pick number, either.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><inline1><\/p>\n<p>Falk idolizes Brady, modeling his game after the five-time Super Bowl champion and even following the TB12 program, Brady's unique approach to off-field training.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\"It's a pretty crazy coincidence -- [he's] somebody I look up to,\" said Falk, a former walk-on who became the all-time Pac-12 leader in career passing yards, touchdowns and total offense (passing Titans starter <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576980/marcus-mariota\">Marcus Mariota<\/a>) while at Washington State.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Falk sees a lot of parallels between their careers prior to the NFL.<\/p>\n<p>\"We have the same similarities in terms of style of play,\" he said. \"We're not the most mobile guys. We can do stuff in the pocket, creating throws in a small space. [We're] accurate, kind of have the same compact throwing motion. He's the best to do it. Somebody to look up to that I've always tried to model my game after. It's a huge coincidence, pick 199. I'm so grateful that Tennessee took a shot on me.\"<\/p>\n<p>Falk is expected to develop as a backup behind Mariota. Both players share the same agent. Veteran <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13987/blaine-gabbert\">Blaine Gabbert<\/a> was signed to be Mariota's backup, but Falk likely will compete with him and could force the Titans and new coach Mike Vrabel -- Brady's former teammate in New England -- to keep three quarterbacks.<\/p>\n<p>Falk also has Nashville ties. He has two sisters who live there trying to make it as country singers. He joked he has somewhere to stay temporarily when he arrives in Nashville.<\/p>\n<p>Ranked 96th on ESPN analyst Mel Kiper's Big Board, Falk said he was surprised to still be on the board in the sixth round. But he attributes it to the next step of his football career, having to exceed lower expectations.<\/p>\n<p>\"I expected to get off the board a little earlier ... The word that came to mind was 'shocked.' It wasn't exactly how I thought it'd play out,\" Falk said.<\/p>\n<p>\"It's been a pretty grueling process. When I finally got the phone call and saw my name on the TV, nothing but gratitude. It's been an interesting football career -- I had two scholarship offers, both pulled. Went to Washington State, seventh guy on the depth chart, trying to claw your way up. Your locker is in a different spot. You're not able to eat with the team. You're paying for your own books. You're paying for your own way. It's tough. I thought it got me to have a gritty attitude, a 'can do' mindset and knowing it's a marathon. I'll take all those lessons that I had at Washington State and bring them with me to the next level.\"<\/p>\n<p>Before Falk, the\u00a0only QB taken at No. 199 since Brady was picked was <a

City Chiefs<\/a>\u00a0for only a few minutes Saturday when he started with the trash talk with his father, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/oak/oakland-raiders\">Oakland Raiders<\/a> general manager Reggie McKenzie.<\/p>\n<p>\"I can't wait to whip up on you twice this year and the next year and the next year and the next year after that,'' Kahlil said he told his father. \"We're a

We compete in everything we do. This just adds one more ripple into that. We're all excited for it. I'm excited to get to Kansas City and just help the Chiefs ... whoop up on the Raiders [and] whoop up on the rest of the NFL.''<\/p>\n<p>The Chiefs drafted McKenzie out of Tennessee in the sixth round. He was a defensive lineman in college, but the Chiefs said they will move him to guard.<\/p>\n<p><inline1><\/p>\n<p>McKenzie said that decision pleased his father, a former linebacker for the Raiders. Reggie's twin brother, Raleigh, had a 16-year NFL career as an offensive lineman with four NFL teams.<\/p>\n<p>Kahlil did some offensive line drills at his pro day at Tennessee at the request of some NFL teams, including the Chiefs.<\/p>\n<p>\"He had a sly little smile on his face,'' Kahlil said of his father. \"I told him, 'It's a conspiracy. This is you. You did this.' He always wanted me to play offensive line. He was happy to see me play offensive line and said that I moved really well doing it. He said I looked like an offensive lineman doing those drills.''<\/p>\n<p>Reggie's eyes welled with tears when talking about what it was like seeing his son drafted.<\/p>\n<p>\"I'm proud of him, and I told him that. I told him, 'We take you, we're going to put you on the offensive line, too,'\" Reggie said.<\/p>\n<p>The elder McKenzie said he received a text from former Raiders standout Charles Woodson once Kahlil's selection by the Chiefs was announced.<\/p>\n<p>\"He told me, 'Your son has to retire. There's no way he's going to put that red helmet on his head.' Part of me felt that way,\" Reggie said. \"But in all seriousness, it's a good opportunity for him, and I was hoping he would land in a spot that would kind of grow him to that position.<\/p>\n<p>\"He can play D-tackle, but I think he probably could be special on the offensive line. And that's where we wanted to play him.\"<\/p>\n<p><em>ESPN's Paul Gutierrez contributed to this report.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n"}],"resultsLimit":25}]},{"name":"rightcolumn","description":"Right
